"Im going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how Im worthless and how I shouldnt be here. Ive never tried or contemplated suicide. Ive always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it. How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","If everyone thinks youre worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with.Seriously, the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteem.Otherwise, you can go round and round trying to understand why youre not worthless, then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again.There are many inspirational messages you can find in social media. Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless, and that everyone has a good purpose to their life.Also, since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesnt feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible.Bad feelings are part of living. They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good.Bad feelings do feel terrible. Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today."
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, Im a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and Im beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but Ive been happily married for almost 35 years. Ive never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling. In fact, most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected. In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care. Basically, its like a road map of where you want to go, how are you going to get there, looking at stopovers, some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic, however, necessary. Of course, these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts, feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control. I would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by cojourneying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia, depression and anxiety, as well as being a breast cancer survivor. Then to help you by developing new coping strategies. Psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be. I know you can do it and you will see firsthand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck.I like to quote Nike where their motto is,just do it.You can do it."
"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep. As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down. It is normal to feel down once in a while. From this place of selfacceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind. Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal. They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment. They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, selfacceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!"
Im facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like Im going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me. How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Have you used meditation or hypnosis? Relaxing the mind and connecting with your true self is a great way to calm your thoughts and get to peace and calm. Hypnosis and meditation have helped a lot of people with anxiety and depression. Google hypnotherapists near me or write for a while about what is going on.
How can I get to a place where I can be content from day to day?,"Your question is a fascinating one!As humans we have the ability to reflect on situations in our lives.Even if nothing currently goes on in a particular moment, its possible youre reflecting on a serious or upsetting matter.And, our emotions linger within us.Just because a particular moment feels calm, inside your feelings may be the sense of a strong unsettled emotion from the recent past.Good for you to be aware of your own sensitivity to living with awareness of your moods and thoughts."
"I have a severe back problem. Ive had 3 major and several minor operations, but Im still in constant pain. How can I deal with the depression from this chronic pain?","Chronic pain at the back likely results from a few areasL4L5 kidney zone, most likely lower backBone spurs, fused discs, and slipped discs, caused by connective tissue weakness, and calcium deposits used to neutralize highly acidic areas...The depression will evaporate when the chronic pain is drained out, through natural meansPharmaceutical means will simply extend the pain and cause it to deepen over time, not solving the problemRemember, medical doctors suppress, natural doctors cure..."
"I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician wont help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?","If it is simply counseling that you seek, any number of faithbased outfits are very willing to listen and help out with these sorts of matters, free of charge Online messaging and social media is a secondary option, however this one may come with privacy concerns and consequencesIf it were I, I would attempt to sweettalk one or two counselors I come across to do a bit of work for folks who cant afford it"
"A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection, Now Im In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and its diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?","First step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based, not a medical condition which requires care and attention.If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life, or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself.Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it.If you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt. If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem, she can avoid looking at herself.There may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem.Medicine looks for symptoms to treat.Our emotional lives are much more indirect.If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life.Basically, do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same.You may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away."
"I struggle with depression as well as pretty intense mood swings throughout the month. I experience highs where I feel amazing and energetic and then lows where I lack focus, energy, and generally have a more dark outlook on my life. How can I live a more balanced life?","Its fun to ride the roller coaster from time to time, isnt it? But, its also wearymaking, and leads to drainage that no man or woman can hardly anticipate!Balance comes with proper understanding of the different bodies you possess and how they function.And, to begin, we focus upon your physical, and move right up the latter to the spiritual, and begin cleaning you out.Unbalance is an experience of blocked energies that should be naturally flowing call them what thou mayest when blockages are removed, what is naturally there flows, and flows beautifully..."
"I selfharm, and I stop for awhile. Then when I see something sad or depressing, I automatically want to selfharm.","In a way, selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction. According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior. Someone who is trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy andor Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you."
"I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor. They wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog, I have the paper work, and I gave it to my apartment manager. They said I cant keep the ESD because Im not disabled. What do you suggest I do?","This can be a difficult situation. Typically, only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as Service Animsls. Even though that can be very helpful, emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same way.You might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you. If possible, you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly."
"I tried telling my husband I was depressed, and he ignored me. He said youre always sad or depressed. And he picked up his phone and ignored me. I said, Please dont exaggerate, that isnt true. And he said, Whatever babe. You just want to be sad. How can I get through to him so he will take me seriously?","Ouch. Its really hard to deal with a spouse that isnt taking you seriously. In this case, I would plan for and schedule a time to talk with him about this. I would tell him that you need about 30 minutes to talk to him with minimal interruptions about something that is important to you. Schedule a time, write notes if you need reminders about what you need to express, and tell him how you feel.Ideally, you would focus more on Istatements instead of telling him what he is doing wrong. For example, I feel ignored vs You always ignore me. By focusing on how you feel, he is less likely to feel attacked and get defensive.Some people go to couples or marriage counseling for help with communication. Chances are there are things that BOTH of you do that hurts your communication. Overall, try to talk to him directly and try not to get defensive. If he continues to say, youre always sad then stay calm, say okay, can you help me understand that more? or Thats interesting. Tell me what you see. Reach out to a couples counselor for more help with communication strategies. Sometimes a 3rd party can help you both see things in a different perspective. Hope this helps!"
"Its not entirely true to say I enjoy being sad, but I always find a way to feel that way. I listen to sad music, read tragic stories, and, in a twisted way, like how bad it makes me feel. I focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or I just make it seem negative.","It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why. This may sound counterintuitive, but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way. A simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life, and they may even know it, but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using. Now I am not saying that what you describe is an addiction, it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefit.One thing I would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content? Id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings. These are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist."
Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather. How can I fight this?,"Seasonal Affective Disorder S.A.D. is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. Everyone suffers with some form of this lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc. while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. Its important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools.2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. Its easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D. Light. These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies, as well as the release of growth hormone which releases when we wake up. There are mixed reviews of these products, however, and they can be expensive."
"I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?","Going through a divorce is often a very low point for the people involved.Are you surprised that your soon to be ex doesnt help with your teenage daughter?Usually patterns and dynamics in parenting are not sudden developments.Is it possible that what youre feeling now is more intensity to the stress of parenting by yourself, not that this is a sudden problem?This is relevant because you may be more familiar and more capable than youre giving yourself credit. The lack of emotional support is definitely stressful.Your parenting skills may still be at the level at which they were prior to the divorce.Take your emotional weariness seriously and reflect on the various ways of stress relief which are available and interest you.Give yourself extra time to rest, nurture yourself and be flexible in finding what feels right for stabilizing yourself.Since you talk about your daughter and help in physical ways, if it is a matter of strength that you need, talk with your attorney so that the child custody agreement includes whatever is physically necessary in the way of strength, in taking care of your daughter.The Courts are very good at making effort that the custody agreement offers proper care to the kids."
"I just dont know what I want in life anymore. Im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I cant put things into perspective at all. Im just stuck, and Im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.","If you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly.Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, its easy to recreate this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. Take one small step at at a time. Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching. Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food!"
"Im not suicidal and wouldnt take my own life, but sometimes, Ive wished for an accident to occur and take it. I feel like I just shouldnt be here and wish I wouldnt have been born so I didnt have to go through life. For me, its a chore, but I dont know if thats normal or a sign of something.","Sounds like a sign of great unhappiness, or sadness, or insecurity.The real way youll find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question. Inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your question.Everyone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while. Its normal to not feel entirely happy all the time.Try to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are, what you like, whom you like.Study yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy."
I cant even smile or fake one. I cant feel happiness about anything and I cant show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly. I cant get over the loss of a loved one and Im not close to my family. What can I do?,"Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since youre sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this. Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"Youre probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions dont happen in a vacuum. If youve had any experience with addicts at all, then Im sure youve heard the term enabler. A lot of the times, when people think theyre helping, theyre actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they usedrink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Dont pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesnt need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but dont try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldnt be a bad idea for you to do the same."
"Im a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. Its tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when Im the second youngest, and Im not stable. My mother and sisters say Im overdramatic. Im just so hurt, and I keep breaking down.","Each person handles themselves differently in any situation.Since you are willing to speak about how you feel, keep looking for blogs and forums on whatever topics you feel most describe your current circumstance.Your mother and sister, even though they are family seem to prefer the opposite method to yours.Find your own path of supportive other people and possibly a therapist.This way youll have understanding and validation which your mom and sister dont want to give you right now."
"Im in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like Ive lost my identity, and I dont know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know Id feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why cant I just enjoy it?","Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolution.Wife and mother are meaningful positions. And in your case, in order to feel your own growth, other areas of who you are would like your attention.Give yourself time to allow your interest to wander in order to find the area of growth which will satisfy you.Just like you know now that youd like more than your current situation, trust yourself to know you will also know when youve arrived at another road youd like to take for your own happiness."
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment.Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question.Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events.Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive selftalk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey."
"There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like Im just out with friends and I never go home.","From the little bit you wrote, my guess is you havent figured out where and how to lay down your own set of roots.Usually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselves.Unless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a fulltime job, would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work, would offer you a way to establish your identity?My suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes, dislikes, and interests. To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify, have a common interest and with whom youd like to socialize.The more you realize who you are, the easier time youll have to find likeminded others and feel securely at home with them and yourself.Again, if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people, then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths."
I am really worried about one of my friends because I think he has major depression. He disagrees with me on that. He is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels. He told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness. I suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses.,"First of all, I can tell that you really care about your friend and I think its great that you are reaching out with your concern. Its hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him, however, whether he does or not, therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges. Unfortunately, you cant make your friend get help. He will ultimately need to make that decision for himself, however, you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help."
Ive become so jaded that I cant control my thoughts. I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks.,"Maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow them!If youre in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life, then the best way through is to understand the tension you feel.It keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within you.Anxiety is a sign of stress and weariness. Your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to know.Then, when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone."
"When I get around a particular person or when I go home, Im just sad or irritated. The feeling comes and goes all day every day. I dont know what wrong. Im not sure if Im just making up symptoms and problems in my head or if there is something actually wrong.","Feelings are real, is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions. Often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy but all feelings have a purpose joy, sadness, anger, frustration, excitement, anxiety, among others. Is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time, so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease.

"I am a teenager. I have been experiencing major episodes of depression if thats even what it is for several years. Its always getting worse. I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I cant control my fears, and I cant even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I dont know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and cant do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.","I understand that talking about our feelings can be awkward and using jokes is a way to relieve that awkwardness, but there is a right or wrong way to talk about your feelings. The important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out, which you are doing already. Having small conversations with your family is helpful, you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it. Since you been experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and have thought about dying, It is VERY important that you ask them to help you make an appointment with a mental health professional.

I feel lazy and numb. I have no interest in things.,Maybe right now it is time for you to rest before the next wave of new activity comes along.To have no interest may mean you are already so saturated with recent situations and their meaning that you are naturally withdrawing in order to regain your energy.
"Im currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and Misophonia. Also, I am 99 sure I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. I read the DSMIV, taken college psychology, etc. I know it in my heart I have them. Is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research?","Any diagnosis is limited in its usefulness.Knowing the name of some typical ways you may feel, think and behave, doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristics.Both selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about it.Consider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are, and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding."
"In the past year, two of my best and only close friends moved to different states. Now I have nobody to hang out with. Im always alone, and I honestly havent hung out with anyone since they left. Im super lonely. What should I do to make new friends? Because they moved and I have no friends now, I think Im falling into a depression or something. I just need help.","Definitely it is sad to lose friends who are a regular part of daily life.How did you meet the two friends who just moved away? Its possible that you could look for similar situations and see if anyone catches your interest to know as a friend.Keeping in mind that friendship is based on trust and common interests, and that these qualities require time to observe and develop, think of what you can do to keep happy while these paths unfold.In addition to being open to meeting new friends, involve yourself in projects from which youll feel satisfied by your own results."
I am the problem. I make my family argue because of me. My mom has even said it. Its constantly like this. I cause problems. I am worthless. I cant stop crying. Sometimes I have to cry myself to sleep. I cant even leave my room because my family cant stand me.,"I am so very sorry for how pressured and sad you feel right now.Definitely all family members have an effect on the other ones.From what you write, your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on you.Also, keep in mind that each person is responsible for deciding to argue or find a different way to discuss a problem. You are not in control of the other people in your family.More likely they take the easy way out and blame you for what they dont want to know about themselves.Stay aware that the familys decision to target you doesnt mean that you are doing something wrong. Certainly your existence is not wrong, which is the degree to which the unfairness seems to have spread.What to do about it is read about family systems to see more explanations on how you are being unfairly treated.Also stay in touch with friends bc these are the people who value and respect you."
"Im depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change.","One way to know yourself a little better and why the dynamics you describe take place, is to understand the particular dynamics of your life context.Look at your major areas of where you spend your time, whether you are happy with the people with whom you socialize, how you feel toward family members and how they seem to feel toward you.If you examine your relationships and life this way then you may start to notice areas where you have some control or at least a say in how your life is going.If you are socializing among people whom you dont like, have a job you dont like and your family mistreats you and you mistreats them, for example, then anxiety and depression are an understandable natural result.If you make improvements in your life and relationships, even tiny improvements and even the effort and intention to improve, you may find your anxiety and depression dissipating.People usually feel their worst when they feel lack of control in their life.Look for ways you can regain andor strengthen yours."
Im very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so. There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists, as you can see them online or in an office. My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist. Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to . Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have. Many times, therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit."
Im constantly in a bad mood and I have no energy. Is that depression?,"Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person. Often times people think depression is more about feeling sad, but depression can, in fact, express itself through irritability or bad mood as you say and lack of energy.According to the DSMV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, depression includes the following symptomsDepressed moodIrritable moodDecreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoySignificant weight change or change in appetiteChange in sleep insomnia or hypersomniaPsychomotor aggitation or retardationFatigue or loss in energyFeelings of worthlessness or excessive guiltDiminished ability to concentrate or indecisivenessThoughts of suicide or planThe great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms. If you are up for it, perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle, values, and capabilities. Good luck!"
"Im in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks. Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right. Are they right, am I depressed?","I wouldnt necessarily say you are clinically depressed based onthat first paragraph in your question. Because that could describe moreintroverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approachas opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others. It is morein the second paragraph that I would be inclined to say that furtherexploration is definitely needed. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder ismore than just those two symptoms, but there are more mild forms of depressionthat can be equally damaging to someone if left untreated.However, one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone whofeels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having atherapist know them, and even less worthy of being helped. Do you feel thatmight be you? If so, could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture,and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself, and realizing thatthoughts and feelings arent always rational in that you are worth getting thehelp?My recommendation just from the information would be that you seekout a supportive, listening ear in the form of a therapist, who can allow youthe space to express some of these difficult experiences, and help you name FORYOURSELF, what your struggle is. To empower you to name it for yourself, asopposed to everyone labeling andor judging you for it, might be an extremelyworthwhile start for you."
She has trouble falling and staying asleep and shes always either extremely hungry or not hungry at all. She also gets angry and feels like crying really easily for no reason. She says she is always kind of down. Is this depression? What can I do to help her?,"Sounds like signs of someone who is depressed.Since the person in question is your friend, offer your friendship to listen to any situations or feelings she has about herself and the way her life is going.Depressed people are often lonely people and feel as though no one around them cares or notices them. Your willingness to be available to her may lift her spirits. Feeling loved goes a long way to dissolving depressed feelings.Also, if in the beginning when you offer to talk, there is a high chance shell be defensive and turn down your offer.Try again on another day and then another day.When people feel depressed they usually shut down. So you may need a few or several tries before your friend accepts your offer to show her you care about how she is doing.Also, watch for signs within yourself that your friends depression is not sinking your emotions. Depressed people are draining to be around because they often see and talk about only the negatives and drawbacks of situations."
"Im a teenager and I I go through periods of moodiness. I have extreme feelings but I bury them, and then I feel nothing just empty and emotionless. I have trust issues, low self esteem,ban extreme fear of abandonment, and I constantly reevaluate my relationships. I also dont know who I am as a person. Im not happy overall, but Im not suicidal. Can I just feel happy?","Sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just described.Teenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness. The fact that you recognize your great range of feelings, as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be, is healthy.Also healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problem.One path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolve.Do you have trust issues because someone broke your trust?Youre entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person. Even if the person never offers this to you, to know you deserve to be restored to whole, may help you feel more secure.The same is true with the other topics, abandonment and relationships generally.The more you continue to value your unique understanding, expectations, and standards, the more likely youll create relationships which do not have these qualities, and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way."
"I had a very troubled up bringing and Im currently dealing with alot right now. I know some people may not think so, but to me its a lot. I feel overwhelmed. Could this be depression? I use to be in therapy as a child. Alll throughout elementry, middle, and high school I had counseling 23 times a week. I havent be in counseling lately though.","What matters most is how you feel and what youre doing, with whom youre interacting, whether you feel youve got enough interaction to be happy.Whether or not a clinician would decide to identify you as depressed matters much less than how you actually are feeling, if you have some ideas as to what might improve your sense of being, and how to go about reaching your goals.If therapy during your childhood made you feel better and you feel you may be depressed, then trying therapy at this point in your life, makes sense.The worst that can happen is you find you feel better than you first understood.The best that can happen is you find a caring therapist who helps you find faith in yourself again."
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and hell go on his phone all day. He doesnt seem motivated to do much and hes often angry. I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.
My mother is combative with me when I say I dont want to talk with her about my depression. She hasnt been supportive of me in the past and she isnt someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I dont want to or cant answer. I tell her I dont want to talk and she starts arguments with me. How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.Youre doing the right move to state you dont want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression. If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept. You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this."
I just feel sad all the time and I dont like anyone in my family. I feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow.,"Hello,While one can be sad from time to time, feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression. If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process. You do not have to deal with it alone. Dr. Virginia Chow, Montreal Psychologist. For more information about depression, please consult my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca"
"I cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Thank you for posting. Im interested to hear some more information such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to schoolemployedunemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not alwaysfeel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions Am I being realistic when Im overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasnt feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy? Hopefully this helps get you started."
I know I need to deal with my depression. But I dont know how and I dont want to tell anyone. How can I deal with depression without telling anyone?,"Love yourself more and treat yourself kindly, with empathy and compassion.Usually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated. Since at this time you wouldnt want to tell anyone about the way you feel, which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support, give this to yourself.Also consider to make a goal of eventually telling someone whom you are reasonably sure would understand and empathize, about your depression.This will help alleviate the sense of shame, unworthiness and pervasive guilt which often comes along with depression.Sending you good luck!"
Im dealing with an illness that will never go away and I feel like my life will never change for the better. I feel alone and that i have no one. How can I overcome this pain and learn to be happy alone?,"Is it possible that even though your illness is chronic, that it goes through phases in which you are more comfortable and that it requires less focus from you than at other times?I think the idea of having a lifelong illness is frustrating and can be depressing to think about. Thoughts are not necessarily the truth of what will actually happen though.Illness makes negative situations look worse so be sure you are concentrating on specific areas of your life and not just assuming they will work out badly because you are ill.One way to be happy alone is to love and appreciate, nurture and be kind to yourself.This frame of mind may generate new answers to find ways of being among other people too."
"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that theyre gone, I feel sad. Its been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a persons life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred, is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote selfcare. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes."
"I feel like I am internally screaming all the time. Externally, I am calm, but I have this intense, unidentifiable emotion constantly. I dont feel sad. I dont cry a lot. I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming. It kind of feels like Im a caged animal.","It is hard to make a definite diagnosis however I would say that it could be and or a combination of depression, stress, PTSD, etc. More background information would have to be needed. One thing I would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms. If what you described as a caged animal is released, all the crying, sadness, and controllable emotions will come out. That would not be good when they do. Get help before they do.."
"Ive never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesnt believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either. Im a pansexual, but I cant trust my own parents. Ive fought depression and won however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends dont listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they dont always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","First of all, I am sorry that you have been missing out on your childhood. It may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods, as well, and that despite such deprivations, for many of us, our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults. I recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to. This may be a teacher, a coach, a school counselor, a minister, a family member, or a friends family member. If none of these are available, try out a professional counselor, social worker, psychiatric nurse practitioner, psychologist, or a psychiatrist. It is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider."
"I dont know how else to explain it. All I can say is that I feel empty, I feel nothing. How do I stop feeling this way?","A feeling of emptiness can be from a lack of awareness and acknowledgment for the things, the people, the places that you have in your life. The use of affirmation and gratitudes helps to remind ourselves of all of the aspects of our lives."
"People who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. It makes me feel like Im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. I have had jobs, but I am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. Any time I bring these things up, I am expected to be over the issue. These are people that you cant just cut out, but I have never received apologies for so much of my pain. I dont know what to do any more. I dont know who I am anymore.","It sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you, and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life, you are feeling invalidated. It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued. In working with a therapist, you may be able to get some clarity about your past, who you are, and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships, so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you."
I am going through a very hard time and Im so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and its normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. Theres a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck.Lulling yourself with selfcare sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort.The part of your situation thats depression feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, thats different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If youre not sure, you can try 800lifenet or other support line to get feedback.First aid for depression includes daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exerciseeven when you dont feel like ithealthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you arent able to move yourself out of your depression, work with a professional to make shortterm goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an antidepressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen"
"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasnt the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though Im not selfharming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if its not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others, which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldnt be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.","I couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm.From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success, it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming.Stress management is just that, management of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you."
"Ive been depressed for quite a while. Ive been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a 5000 deductible, so Im screwed. Ive had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family doesnt care about me they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My exboyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.","It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress, social anxieties, etc. for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit.Depression is allencompassing, and, based on what youve written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways. The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program EAP if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT, such as Mind Over Mood."
"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I dont mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,to getfollowup care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You cant remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesnt want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 911 is alwaysagood option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer 18002738255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC"
I always feel like Im doing something wrong. Everything I do is crappy. I want to cry all the time. I cant eat or sleep.,"You are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression low self esteem, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, sad mood, feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness. A full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that Do you think you are depressed? People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . Ill ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or cant find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modifydecrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. I hope you find this information helpful. The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life."
"I no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fiance.",Sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too. I would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger. I would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard. Its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them.
"Im depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because Im scared of the reactions Ill get. Last time I tried telling my parents, it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed Im a legal adult, calling me ungrateful, and telling me that if I cant handle things now, its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true. Its exhausting pretending to be okay, and I dont know how much longer I can try. Im just really tired, and sadly, I cant afford the help I need on my own.","Hi Georgia, Theres a really good lesson here. People tell us things, and we tend to think thats the truth...but its not! Ill do some translating for you...Youre so ungrateful means I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel Im a good parent.Youre too young to be depressed means I dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now. Ill pretend its not happening so I dont have to face my fear and shame.Its only going to get worse just means I dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sake.Your parents are being unsupportive, not because youre not suffering, but because this is all theyre capable of right now. They are not where you will find the support you need, so keep looking for it in other places. Its out there. If might be an aunt or a friend, or a friends aunt. It might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor. Keep looking for someone who will hear you. I hope you dont ever give up."
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. Ive tried various therapists and pills, but nothings helped.","Is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked? If this is possible, interview a therapist before starting therapy. Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isnt for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective."
"Im in my early 20s. Ive worked since two months after I turned 18. I have plans. I could become an electrician, or I could operate heavy machinery. I have goals, but I do nothing to try to meet them because I dont feel I can. I just want a better life for my fiance and the kids than I did.","For starters, commend yourself for being committed to working. You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second, so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story. Remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up. The false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams. Next, do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator? If not, find out. Then, set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps. As you accomplish each step, see your progress. Notice that you are moving closer to your goal. Every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career. In fact, write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror. When you start to feel discouraged, remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out. Anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work. Stay with it! You and your family are worth it!"
"He said he would try and he never did. Its been nine months, and this is making me worse. Today, he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes. Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what Im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? Hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.","Wow that is tough. There is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression. It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already. While depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. With that being said if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then I cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned. This doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision as Im sure you wouldnt but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. If he is wanting to leave this could make things a lot tougher for you. I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family. You do not need to face depression alone nor should you have to. We all need support at tough times like these."
"Im in my late 50s. I never loved or have been loved. I need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. I find myself losing hope more and more. My brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, I forget in a moment. I serve no purpose. Im incapable of work or anything of value, and I never have been. Im a complete waste of time and resources, and yet I keep trying. Why? Why does God insist that I continue to exist? Im not suicidal, just tired.","The fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different, and that drive might be something worth tapping into. Why do I keep trying? is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going.A lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy. As long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service, you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home, even being in your small town. Id recommend looking into this option, because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers."
"Both of my parents committed suicide together, and I was the one who found them. I suffer from overwhelming depression, which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives. He does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex.","Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as apersonal rejection rather thanresponse to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couples counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesnt agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influenceothers, so itmay be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it. I hope this is helpful, and some of my colleagues may have ideas, also. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"I have bipolar disorder, paranoid personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder. I last selfharmed a week ago. When I am stressed, overwhelmed, hurt, or angry, the urge to selfharm is all I can think of. I am trying to seek help.","Seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting though to be honest, that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety. However, many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy DBT. Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful, but askilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions.Without knowing your location, I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline. The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area. Calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmed."
"I stress over everything. If I dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. He has three children, and they are great kids, but I find we dont have much time together. I break down easily and find myself depressed.","Everyone has some level of anxiety its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on. However, if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then Id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety.Your other concerns, though, seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, Ive been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics because even if youre not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership."
"I have been falling into a deep depression where I can no function during the day and night. The only time I am at peace is when Im asleep. If I am with friends, family, at work, and mainly alone, I cannot think straight. I no longer feel like myself.","I dont know how long ago your breakup was, but I would suggest that you reach out to friends or family that you trust and perhaps a local mental health clinician.Im not sure what you mean when you say that you are not able to function during the day and night. If you are having trouble sleeping for more than a few nights, consider talking with your primary care physician. Not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much larger.Can you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup? This may be a starting point for you. I wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake. Also consider looking at things that you can control, such as when you choose to wear, eat, and who you talk to about your deepest feelings.You mentioned that you have friends and family. I wonder if any of them are supportive to you.Please reach out and talk to someone about the details. I get the sense that you feel that you are alone in this, and having someone there to help you sort out what youre feeling sounds like it would be a gift to yourself."
I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I also have voices in my head. I have problems sleeping too. Ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder. I have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal. How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?,"If you have already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder, can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those things?It may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past. I dont know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation, but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them, that may be a way to start the process. As for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal, a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about that.Im not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing, but if you have some support there, perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as well.You mentioned that sometimes you hear voices. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them, that would be a time to ask for immediate help, before you follow through with what they are telling you, perhaps by calling 8002738255. They may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call."
"Im depressed and recently went through a break up. Its like every guy I like only wants me for sex. I think Im ugly, and sometimes I just want to die. I have a son, and I got really big when I was pregnant. I have stretch marks on my stomach.","If you are currently feeling as if you want to die, please call 8002738255 and talk to someone.One way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you. Do you have friends or family who are supportive?Can you find one part of you that you do not think is ugly?If your stretch marks are still bothering you, talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician. Sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right direction.You mentioned mostly physical things here. I wonder if you can find one small thing each day that is going right and build from there. Perhaps your son makes you smile?"
"Im not the same anymore, I dont know how to get back to who I am. Im sad and confused and angry and tired. I dont sleep well.","Being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad, confused, or angry, among other emotions. If youre having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day. Also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed. If you are not sleeping while you are in bed, consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. Hopefully youll be able to establish a pattern.Sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well. Try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes.If youre still struggling, consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician. There are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you."
"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money, doesnt have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you dont have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I dont know how old your child or children isare, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do."
"I dont have time to live or take care of myself at times. Its causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I dont know what to do.",Im not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming. Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start?
"Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues. It has emotionally destroyed me. I now basically hate myself. Its embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone. My family has been in the armed forces, and it has always been my dream. I cant do this alone anymore, and now my family is even worried.","It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you. It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support.Is there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life? I dont know what else your life involves, whether you have close friends or a romantic partner, a career, activities that you like to do, and many other things. You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different direction.Your military service will always be a part of you. Thank you for your service."
"I feel depressed even though I act like a happy with my family. I act like Im happy so my son doesnt see me sad. I act like my life is a happy life, but I feel sad and depressed. I sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me. I just cry and write in my book all these feelings.","It sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time. I would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist. If you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment, please call 8002738255 and talk to someone.While I follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through, that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else. Who is it that you trust or could speak with about this? A therapist could be one person, but perhaps there is someone else in your life as well.One thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy. This could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it. If you think about this time while holding onto the bead, the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy. You could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safe.Have you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sad?Can you think of anything that makes you feel good, even if it only works for a few minutes?"
"I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. I am on my parents insurance, and they wont let me see a therapist because they dont believe in it.","The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live. In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. If you are under 18, you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in. Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.If you are in school, you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school. This would not require using your insurance."
"When Im sad and alone, I want to cut myself.","Try doing something physical. If you havent exercised before, it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first, but this can be helpful.The more you can find out about when you want to cut, the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do. If you are feeling sad or angry or nervous, look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about that.You said you are alone. I would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through. This could be a parent, a friend, someone at school, a coworker, or any number of other people."
"I stopped for a while, but Ive started doing it again. Its like an addiction. The more I try to stop, the more I want to do it. Ive tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw, but it doesnt work.","Ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions. Youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting, it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on. While that is still something to work on, it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead. You said drawing doesnt work for you. Sometimes more physical activities, such as doing a few jumping jacks, can be helpful. If you dont exercise, it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut, the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that. Try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut."
"I have friends, family, I live in a good home, I go to a nice high school, and I get pretty good grades, but I dont know why Im so unhappy. These friends are my best friends and theyre all amazing people, and yet Im sad all the time and feel alone.","I wonder if you have moments where you feel happy?You say you have amazing friends. I wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around them.Sometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do really well at everything all the time and this can be overwhelming sometimes. Where do you have support? I hope you can tell someone that you are feeling sad so that you can talk about your feelings.Sleeping can make a big difference as far as feeling sad as well. If youre not sleeping well at night, that could be a big part of feeling sad a lot.Perhaps you could try to find a person or two who makes you feel totally safe and comfortable and try to talk with them."
"I used to be the funny guy of the groupthe class clown, if you will. I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward. Now I cant laugh at all, and Im dead inside.","If you look back to when you feel as though you were the funny guy, I wonder what is different now? It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.I dont know whether youre also saying that you feel sad or if youre saying that you feel as though you dont have any big changes in your feelings.A lot of us tend to be really busy, and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we dont have time to have positive time for ourselves. Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends, were thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do.I wonder if it feels awkward when youre with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to. Maybe if that is more comfortable for you, it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments.It sounds as if you may have had an experience or more than one where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward. If so, try going back to people you trust. Who do you have support from?"
"Im starting to think that I might have depression. The thing is though, Im not exactly sad. I can joke with my friends and stuff, but Ive stopped caring about my work, and Ive been starting to think that life is pointless. I really have no clue if I need help, or if Im just tired or something.","It is possible that you have depression, but you could also be experiencing some other changes that mean that you have feelings of being sad without actually being depressed. Your statement makes it sound like youve stopped caring about your work, but youre still going to work and doing your work. It almost sounds like you are dissatisfied with your work. Do you like what you do?When you said that life is pointless, what makes it that way? What is keeping you going? Is there something you can do each day that you can find meaning in?You mentioned that you are not sure if you need help or are just tired. It sounds like you could certainly benefit from talking with someone about more specifics.Im curious about how long you have felt this way and if you are aware of anything that is contributing to it."
"In the last ten months, Ive been kicked out, moved around three times, worked many jobs, stopped school to make money, had dad and mom get sick, was cheated on while pregnant, lost my baby, had relationship issues, and was betrayed. I cant get a job. I have no friends. I feel lonely and isolated. Ive been dealing with all this by myself.","One thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over. If you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day, this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices. For example, you say you cant get a job, but I wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job, like Career Link. You say you have no friends currently. Are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact with?You mentioned that you have no friends. Is there anyone in your life that you can talk with, even if its not someone that you consider a closest friend?"
"Ive been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated. I want to break things, hit myself, run away, kick, scream, and cry. I just want to be happy and outgoing again. I want to be able to take care of my daughter and live comfortably.","Philadelphia, there is help out there. For your daughters sake, start somewhere. Feelings are only that your worst fears about who you are are only based on a few moments that havent gone well. Depression is so treatable, but you have to seek treatment from a professional.Heres a quick exercise for you to do that can show you how therapy might work... fear is telling you the worst possible story of your life, right? So... if there was an opposite story...the very best story that someone could tell about you and your life...what would that be? Who would be telling it? Someone who loves you? Someone who was around you when you were that outgoing person? Someone whos been watching your life from the start? God? Write that best story. I dare you to give it as much credibility as the worst one.Therapy is often about helping people reject their worst stories. I invite you to start exploring with a qualified therapist whatever barriers stand between you and your best life. I hope you reach out soon."
"I keep feeling paralyzed and unsure during interviews. Previous jobs have fired me for lack of performance, and five employers have rejected me after extensive personality tests and interviews. Im afraid of continuing because my depression is getting worse. Im already humiliated working for temp agencies and doubt my selfworth as a provider for my family.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to improve your work situation and worrying that you wont be able to. It is possible that the paralysis, uncertainty, and selfdoubt that you describe are contributing to your difficulty in getting and maintaining a satisfying job as employers generally like to see that a potential employee is confident and can think on his or her feet. With a competent therapist, you may be able to get more understanding of the roots of these feelings and learn how to move forward in your search for a better work life in a way that leaves you feeling confident and capable."
"I feel like I am not at a good state of mind. Im very unsettled in my soul. Im not happy with myself or the decisions I make, which makes me not happy with anyone else. I feel like a failure most of my days. I dont feel like Im good at anything anymore. I feel like less of a person.","It seems like you may be experiencing depression symptoms, they could be the triggered by unexpected life changes, or building up throughout time.The important part is that you have identified them and wanting to change them.

You mentioned that you feel unsettled in your soul explore your spirituality, meditate about what makes your soul at peace, and find ways to practice that or surround yourself by those activities.If you find it difficult to begin, talk to your therapist to identify roadblocks and ways to find motivation. Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are common but serious depression symptoms, discuss them with your therapist, contact your doctor or psychiatrist, and call 911 if its and emergency.Once you feel stable, you can focus on exploring the source of the problem and see if you need to make changes or learn coping skills that will help you manage it.

"I am not sure if I am depressed. I dont know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","You are not alone, many people fear opening up to family members about the topic of depression or mental illness. There are many different reason why some may fear telling their parents. The most common thoughts I hear in my office are My parents wont understand me, I may cause more problems to the family, I am worried that something bad may happen if I tell them.If possible express your current concerns and worries to your parents.

For example, tell yourself something positive before talking to your parents such as I feel confident in myself, and I am doing this to overcome my fear of talking to my parents can help to decrease the anxiety you are feeling leading up to the conversation.I would recommend if you are feeling depressed or down it would be beneficial to seek counseling to understand your current thoughts and behaviors. Best of luck and hope you decide to start counseling."
"I have absolutely nothing to do with my life but lay in bed on my phone or hangout with my one friend. I dont have a job, my family doesnt include me in anything, and I dont have many friends. I have nothing to do besides go on my phone. I miss talking to people in person instead of online. I dont even talk to my family in person even from the other room.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty stuck, lonely, and hopeless like you have a desire to be more connected to people and to find purpose in life, but are not sure what to do. I am glad to hear that you have at least one friend and I think it is great that you are reaching out for more connection. If you can, working with a therapist who is competent in treating depression may be a huge benefit to you and help you to regain a sense of meaning, motivation, and connection. Additionally, anything you can do to give yourself a little break from the feeling of pointlessness and any ruminating thoughts you may be having may be of help. I know it may sound pointless in the moment, and you may feel a great deal of inertia in doing so, but you may find that if you force yourself to do something small that is pleasurable, like taking a walk for example, theres a good chance you will be glad that you did so after the fact. Thank you for reaching out."
My motivation has gone away. Its hard to get out of bed. I really dont know what to do anymore. Im miserable. My anxiety and depression have taken over my life.,"Anxiety and Depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis. I would say that both are challenges to overcome but solutions to living healthy and well exist. Step 1 Talk about it. With friends, family, partners, counselors, and other trusted people in your life. Step 2 Create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms. Step 3 Dont give up. Working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning. Stick with it and you will be able to find exercises, tools, and resources that help you live well."
"I sleep a lot. Music changes my mood. I cry every Wednesday. My mind is like a maze that even I get lost in. I dont usually feel my true emotions, but instead, I get fake mirrored ones.","What happens in your life on Wednesdays that you feel like crying? Crying is natural. Crying on Wednesdays may also be natural if some type of regular event or situation comes up for you then that you dont like, feel oppressed by and have no way of avoiding.Maybe you would qualify for a diagnosis for depression.This matters less than what you will do with a diagnosis. Very often people feel some type of relief from hearing a professional tell them what they have.Dont let yourself get talked into taking pills because now you have something. Pills change your mood.Only you can change your life.The diagnosis matters so the therapist gets paid from insurance.It is a good sign that you know whether you feel true emotions or fake ones. This is a clear sign of knowing about yourself.Your mind feeling like a maze is a little too vague to know if you mean there are too many thoughts at once so that you have difficulty knowing which ones to examine first, or if maze means you dont know what your thoughts are and feel lost for this reason.Depression which is addressed by a person can become quite liberating because you will remove what bothers you so much in your life that it weighs you down and depresses you."
I have twin toddlers. I experienced a death of loved one prior to giving birth. I had a horrible break up with the father. People told him he was using me for money. My exboyfriend had extreme meltdowns every day for three years. Im always alone with no friends.,"First, let me say that you are a survivor and a warrior. Managing 1 child by yourself is difficult, but twins is a whole different ballgame. Anxiety can affect us at any time anywhere. This is the challenge, especially when we have so many things to manage each day. There are several methods and practices that help manage and even reduce symptoms of anxiety. It will depend on what works best for you. Talk with friends, a counselor, or a loved one who can offer you support and feedback as you navigate this process of learning what works for you. When all else fails make sure you are in a safe place, pause for a deep, cleansing breath in, a long exhale out, and ask yourself, What do I want in this moment? Now you can begin again."
"I live a normal life. I have tons of friends and family, but I feel lonely.",This may be happening because you and the others are not connected to each other on a level which reaches your emotions.Loneliness may show the absence of feeling a variety of emotions when you are among others.How many friends you have doesnt affect whether you and someone else feel emotionally engaged with one another.Consider if you feel like concentrating your friendship on more intensively sharing your feelings with a few of your friends.This may lead to fewer friends who are also more meaningful to you and your feeling a decrease of loneliness.
"I started having anxiety three months ago. Im new to having anxiety, and its making me depressed.","One of the first steps is to manage anxiety and depression symptoms are to establish a goodselfcareroutine. Start with the most basic things Eating balanced meals, sleeping at from 68 hours and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. These will help you to regulate the chemical imbalance thataffectsyour mood, plus exercising gives you time to vent and be distracted from your thoughts. Once basicselfcareis established, I suggest that is a good time to start exploring the source of these feelings, and address them trough therapy. If you have difficulty initiatingselfcareroutine talk to your therapist about what motivates you and pushes you to do things, you might find the key during the process. You could also contact your physician or a psychiatrist to discuss medicationoptionsif its too challenging to begin basicselfcare.Cmo puedo controlar mi ansiedad?Uno de los primeros pasos para manejar la ansiedad y la depresin es establecer una buena rutina de cuidado personal.

"I have no friends, no hobbies, and no interest in anything. I get annoyed with everything and everyone. I am always tired, i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired. I dont know what to do. Is this normal?","Hello, and thank you for your question. It certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going. Here are a few thoughts and ideas1. If you havent seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesnt hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal. These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember, the symptoms are the problem, not YOU. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness. In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism?We can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party. This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, You are worth nothing or You dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time.The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. Looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy."
"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically."
"Ive had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out. I want to overcome it, but its so vivid, its like its happening again. Im scared and paranoid. I have depression, which I have been struggling with since a young age.","I understand that at times its difficult to share with our parents what we have been trough, due to fear of judgment or punishment but I have noticed that keeping our experiences secret, intensifies them. And Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can haunt us for a long time if we do not learn to process the memories that cause those symptoms. If you have been victim of a traumatic event that you are not prepared to share with your parents, its important that you seek help with a counselor, therapist or psychologist. Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great technique to cope with physical symptoms, you could also use Narrative therapy, Creative Therapy or Journaling as a way to express memories and process them with your therapist. A psychiatrist can also prescribe medication to manage the symptoms, but is very important that you address the trauma so you can heal and go back to live your life. Many organizations like the United Way 211 in many states offer resources and referrals to put you in touch with mental health providers, you could also talk to your school counselor, doctor or church to find referral that could help.Tip You dont have to tell you story to each person you ask for help, you can just start by asking for a counselor referral.Cmo puedo superar el Desorden de Estrs Post Traumtico sin que mis padres se enteren?Comprendo que muchas veces puede ser difcil compartir nuestras experiencias con nuestros padres, muchas veces por miedo a que nos juzguen o castiguen pero he observado cmo mantener un secreto, lo vuelve ms fuerte y difcil de manejar.

"My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I cant handle it anymore.",Its never to late to get help with grief. Get help as soon as possible before you are feeling the same way 5 years from now. You will always miss your Dad but getting help with coping with his loss will make life easier to live.
"I am a single mother. As a child, I was molested by my mothers boyfriend. I never knew my father. I started having children at 18 right after high school. After having children, I completely lost myself and gave all of my focus on my children. Now my children are getting older, but I still dont know myself. Ive had several attempts at relationships, and they all fail. I stopped caring about a lot after my childrens father left me. I fell into a spiral and got depressed.","What your are experience is normal for most women. We usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside. So to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself I usually do a 6 session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session What do I love? other than your children What are my own needs and desires? What 3 things have I accomplished in my life that Im most proud of? What are 5 strengths or qualities I have? What is one event that had a major impact on my life? How have that event affected my life today? For their homework assignment after the 1st session, they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love, cherish, appreciate and even admire about themselves. Most women feel awkward at first, but I remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself, you are to love and support others."
"I always see the worst end of things. My boyfriend and I arent talking, and I swear hes leaving me. I keep failing my road test, and I see my future crumble. I have no desire for friends. I pushed my best friend away after Christmas, and I have no desire to fix it or make new friends. My aunt died, and I cry all the time, even if I burn my lunch.","I really love that youre taking responsibility for your pessimism here. Theres a modern parable about two young brothers. One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and hes miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure, and hes flinging it around with joy. So then someone comes and asks the first boy why hes so miserable, because he has so much. He says that hes missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why hes so happy in a room full of manure, and he says With all this sht, theres gotta be a pony in here somewhere!Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe its possible. Thats a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say I always see the worst end of things. Thats pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around the view will change.The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary this will pass. I know how to fix friendships, 2. Specific not involving the whole of your life, and 3. not your fault tons of people fail road tests. On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women.The feelings you are having are temporary youre in a slump and its a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how but you lack energy right now. If tackling this on your own isnt enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy. I wish you the best."
"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasnt acting like myself. I was quiet, which Im usually not. I didnt talk to anybody and didnt have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. Were all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and were at our best when were all helping each other. Im glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes.I can tell that youre smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you not being yourself, and then how you felt when your grandma died.When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didnt seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didnt know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but thats how it works.When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldnt like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we dont show ourselves, people cant see who we are they dont know us as well and then they dont know what we need and they cant care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us.So, where youre at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldnt see your pain and know that you needed support.Theres a simple solution, but youd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say Get off my back!. Youre not helping me by telling me lies. Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then theyll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!"
"I was in a situation with a guy. Hes my brothers friend and kind of like a brother to me. He invited me over to hang out, and then came on to me. I was instantly terrified to say no, and I gave in. I dont know whats wrong with me. I cant figure out why Im afraid to say no. This is giving me a lot of guilt and depression.","Hi Tennessee, There is nothing wrong with you. There are many good reasons why you didnt say no. You didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary. You also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people, and to put the needs of other people first. You instinctively want people to like you, and people can be very coercive sexually. You said it yourself you gave in. He wore you down.Theres nothing wrong with you. It wasnt your job to say no. Women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges. It was his job to get your consent first. He pressured you into it.A good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more. If you said no, what might happen then? What might that mean about you? What are you avoiding feeling? Unloved, unwanted, cold? What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no? That you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do? That youre special, or that sexuality is special? Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is?I love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries, and I urge a widespread conversation about what consent it. Men and women of all ages could use more of this training."
"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore Im done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.","Its sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences."
"My life is completely normal, yet I feel empty inside. I feel as if I already know why Im alive to reproduce and die.","Are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty? Start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than empty.If there is no recent example, then in your mind, go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty. Recall what you liked about this time, whether you were by yourself or with others, what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptiness.How did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die? If this is what your parents, siblings and extended family believe, it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living.Give yourself the time to browse around online, or in person social meet ups, on your interests. It is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life, that are brand new to you and which connect to your true self.This is one way of respecting your individuality, which of itself, may decrease your sense of emptiness."
"Im almost never happy. Half of the time, I dont feel anything. I find it easy to make myself feel nothing. I know I push people away because its easier. I just want answers. Im sick of feeling this way. Its ruining my relationships with people.","Maybe you have depression.The name of your condition matters much less than the descriptions you wrote of how you feel.Since youve observed how you sometimes interact with people and realize you arent happy with the result, youve a very solid starting point for reflecting on your deeper wishes in relating to others.Start with asking reasons of yourself about the puzzling aspects of how youre engaging with others.Theorizing as to why you feel that pushing people away is easier, and easier than what?Googling the keywords of how you feel, may open a starting point for ideas on knowing yourself and what you wish for."
"My husband and I are in a terrible place. Part of me wants to fix it, but then Im caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels Im blaming him. Sometimes I am because the feelings of distrust are so strong. I feel they must be coming from something hes doing, but sometimes I know Im being irrational. Still, that doesnt stop the anxiety. The other half of the time, I just want to walk away, but I feel like that will only be a temporary fix.","You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship. This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of you.Has he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you, is contributing to problems in the couple?Is he willing to understand what youre asking of him, without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamed?Your feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood. Hes not willing to listen to you, so of course youre frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelings.Willingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way, sometimes requires a couples therapists assistance.Ask your husband if hes willing to understand, not judge you. Be willing yourself to do the same.If after trying and getting nowhere, youll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapists.Warning, not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy. Ask the therapist if theyve had specialized training in couples therapy.Otherwise, having a referee type therapy session of, what do you think, what do you think?, isnt going to do anything except frustrate both of you further.Good luck!"
"They dont go away, and I feel like Im going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?","Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking, and the voices started shortly after, then yes, it is possible medication created your problem.Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription, about the problem youre having.Crazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not.Certainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy, is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself. And, youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problem.Crazy people usually dont do responsible behaviors."
"A girl and I were madly in love. We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together. She moved away for school, and we attempted a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up. Its been a year now, and I still havent lost my feelings for her. I still love her the same way I did. Ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. Its damaging me and my life.","Hi Boise, Im sorry that youve lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. Its different now...youre not together anymore, but you cant accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. Youve been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really youve not been grieving...youre stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Lets look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that theres something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right. Maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond. Maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send it...it might be worth the risk. Use the next paragraph to help you decide.Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didnt work? Sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If shes asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or If I move forward, that will mean... Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in If this person doesnt love me, then Im unlovable, or No one will ever love me as much as she did. So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourselfI know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.Its part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...thats how I know Im lovable.Its normal to feel sad. Im grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, but not if Im clinging to some old memoryThese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!"
"Ive got so much anger. I dont know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I dont know how to deal with life. Im very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River,You say you have anger but you dont mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesnt. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if youre bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone whos hurting you. However, if they are totally unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When sheyells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldnt be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you.Something about anger...its often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them.You say you dont know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you dont know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people dont! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? Im afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone or falling apart, or feeling alone.... How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about?These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!"
"Ive been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now. I am a young adult, and right now, driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety. I cant ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on. I have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me. I miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack. My family offers little to no support. They think its fake or all in my head. It makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where Id rather never wake up anymore. I am not selfharming, I just feel meaningless. This constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life. I was such a happy person. I want my life back. I want to travel with my friends and family again, but I dont know how. Ive almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that Ill live with this anxiety forever.","Not having support from your family for such a significant problem, is a problem itself.How about your friends, are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problem?Are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger?Maybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life, would help diminish the panic attacks.If no support is coming to you, then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others, especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time.Its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself.If no one wants to show they care about this situation, then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better, while they ignore your need for their support.Be realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need.Thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone. Eventually, youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough time.Hopefully, the others will be more responsive to you.If they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like."
"I am broke, but I am sure I have been depressed for the past couple of years. I have always had anxiety. I just need someone to talk to right now. I dont have any friends or family I can talk to. Im on the verge of just giving up.",Good question. There are resources out there people to talk to. Id try going to this link and calling the free 247 hotline
"I dont know how to have emotions. I never had any from my birth. Being human, I think of myself as a monster. I enjoy pain. I cut myself for my climax during sex. I think most of the time, I lie, even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth. I was in rehabilitation for four year. I have made love with both men and women, but it made no impact in my emotions. The books that I enjoy reading H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. I go hunting every Saturday. I feel powerful. I dont enjoy the killing of the creature, but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature.","Im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions.From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel. Little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth. This is information someone told you or was part of your family system.Possibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yours.Similarly, your comparison of being human means being monster like, is not an obvious connection. Besides, monsters are an idea, they arent real. They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species. Again, I wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you are.A way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple, basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belong.If on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year, you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this, youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotions.If someone buys you a birthday present, be aware of how you feel. Keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions."
I am on my own with my daughter. I am so worried and stressed about her.,"Your instinct to help your daughter, is natural.How you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem, or if only you see this from observing her.Also, her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe.If you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems, and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life, then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her.If your daughter is in your legal control, then you can locate a counselor nearby, discuss your situation with that person, and depending on the outcome, youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor.Starting therapy without willingness to do so, is risky. The person may feel resentful enough to not participate. And, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapy.Family counseling, regardless of your daughters age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.Also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response."
"I just had a newborn. When I brought him home, my mom told me to leave. Now Im in a womens home. I dont see my boyfriend that often because he works. The womens place is helping me find an apartment so I can go back to work and get child care.","Congrats on the birth of your son!Was your moms request for you to leave her house, one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the door?My question is whether your mom had some changed circumstance in her life, whether she and you discussed living arrangements prior to your sons birth, or whether nothing was talked about, you assumed youd be living with her, she assumed you wouldnt, and the two of you didnt speak to one another about any of this.Depending on the answers, there may be clues as to handling future expectations of others, especially your mom.From what you write, the womens home is supportive of your basic daily living needs. It is good news that the people who run this home know and offer community resources.In your interactions with the staff of the womens home, ask all the questions necessary so youll have a clear understanding of the apartment lease, anything at all that is on your mind about becoming employed and finding childcare.The point is to have all the major steps youre about to start, addressed.This way, youll be minimizing the possibility of any sudden bad news by the womens home, told to you.Sending lots of good luck!"
"I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week. A month and a half later, I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair. I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment. I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. However, I still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and I have days where I feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything. Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine?","Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated, as you have noticed, and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications. While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication, as you have pointed out, there are often negative side effects as well. While I cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication. If you can find a doctor, psychiatrist, or ARNP who is competent in mental health, it may also benefit you to consult with them.One thing that I am wondering about is, what is your support system like, in regards to your fight against depression? Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group? While there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression, psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring, competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference."
"At school, it feels like Ive lost all my friends, and Ive been really weird with my sleeping patterns. I used to cut myself, and I really want to again, but I change in the locker rooms because I dont want anybody to see. I get ticked off easy and overreact. At night, Im very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff. Please help me. I just want to be happy again, and I feel like Im starting to fake a smile at school.","As silly as it may sound, making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low. The reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking. I know you feel that you may be losing your friendships, but what are the facts that have led to this belief? Really ask yourself, are they facts? or are they your perspective on events. In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced. As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you. One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way.Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant, though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future."
I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.,"Feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed. As humans, we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied. Given that you are frequently thinking about death, I highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression.The good news is that with proper, consistent treatment and commitment to change, things can really turn around for you. A therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine, change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness, and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are. By learning about where your sadness originates, engaging in preferred activities, and changing your thought patterns, you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression. What will likely result, is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others.Dont give up. Create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus. You have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site. Keep on this path and believe in yourself. Best of luck to you!"
"My fiance suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she cant breathe or move. Sometimes, she wont even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She wont eat or drink in public. If she isnt having a panic attack or crying, shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I cant even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I cant even get her to drive. She doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive. Some people have recommended medication, but I believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I dont want my fiance pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.","It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, wont be able to resolve her mental health issues. Based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation. Whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. You would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couples therapy, in order to address how you are feeling andbest learn how to support her and your relationship. I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later."
Im unemployed just relocated. I cant get approved for a place to live because of past mistakes which follow me to this day. Im depressed and on the verge of loosing my partner because Im overwhelmed and have trouble functioning on a daily basis. I see no light at the end of this tunnel and need some help. I see no point in this chaos infested joke some call life.,"It sounds like you are feeling like things are hopeless and out of control and youre not sure what to do about it. If you can find a competent therapist to work with, together you may be able to come up with some strategies for alleviating the overwhelming distress that you are experiencing and gain some insight into what may be contributing to these challenges. Additionally, a therapist may be able to support you in getting back on your feet in regards to work, a place to live, and showing up with your partner in a way that will be more satisfying to you."
"Im supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life, but Ive never liked it here, not even before I came. Ive never felt like I belong, Ive missed my country every second in the past four months, and Im just miserable. Im gaining weight, doing nothing, and crying for hours straight. Is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock?","It sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting. Without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home, it is hard to say what you should do, however, I think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer."
"I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semirelationship should be joyous, for me, its an emotional nightmare I cant get to the bottom of. Ive had this before and had to leave the semirelationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship? While Im not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I dont take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and Ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","Hi Helena,I felt a bit sad when I read this. This is a new term for me... semirelationship. What does it mean? I know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women Im not sure youre female, but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup. Research tells us that, after a hookup, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then, but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship, and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesnt work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence."
"I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasnt showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but Im still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasnt sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldnt sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didnt have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didnt talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me Im still in love with you, I never stopped loving you, and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasnt just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didnt love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasnt attractive, I wasnt beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100 sure hed never love me again. Im still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasnt good enough and that Im no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but dont know if I should.","I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering. Losing the mostsignificant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous supportmay be necessary for healing to take place. Anytimesadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately.A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are goingthrough, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task,it will only make things easier and give you asense of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals relatedto living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. Witha support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier.Best of luck to you!"
"A friend of mine taking psychology advised I go to my doctor to check if I have major depressive disorder. Im afraid of the consequences of doing so. If I do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder, wont that go on my records? I will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things I may be prohibited from. Im also afraid of taking any antidepressants. This year, my doctor gave me some for a dislocated hip. I had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them. Everyone I know who has taken antidepressants says its a bad idea all around and youre better getting treatment without them. Im concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because I am unable to make decisions on my own. Im not really suicidal, but I am not really taking care of myself either. Someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy. Im not keen on that. Im wondering if I am better off just getting selfhelp and working things out on my own. Its just that Ive been an emotional mess since I was in elementary school. Ive graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy, but I cannot deny I still am not good.","I admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants. Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views, are signs of strength and clarity in a person.As a therapist, I always tell my patients to avoid antidepressants.Their effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings. If someone does not know how they are feeling, then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves, their uncertainties and hesitations, and overall, how they relate to others and what they expect from others.Antidepressants mask how someone feels.In a crisis, temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful. If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning, then suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day, may be of benefit for a short while.Basically, respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants. Your view is shared by many. It is a minority opinion, and very valid.If you would like to shop for a therapist, ask the person on the phone, what their opinions are about antidepressants.Ideally, you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you, or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic.I hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search!"
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. Were going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased selfunderstanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you."
"Ive been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. Im on medicine, but Im struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me arent helping much.","If you are someone who usually has a job, pays or contributes to household bills, and generally manages your own daily life, then here are some suggestions.Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happiness.Since the people whom you currently are in your life arent helping much, consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you.Follow your natural interests. If you like reading, look online for a local book club. If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script. There is almost no human interest in the person.If youd like feeling better as a person, then find people. Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis."
"Im going through a divorce with my wife of three years, who Ive known since the 4th grade and been involved with for seven years! We just had a baby seven months ago and never got along with my mother, who Ive lived with for years. I am now back with my mother because I have nowhere to go with this divorce looming. Im heart broken because I fell into a depression, I havent seen my child in a while, Im having good and bad dreams, and I feel hated. Can you help? Can you intervene? Can I speak with someone?","Its hard to accept the end of a marriage when its not your choice you feel powerless, abandoned and unwanted. Your wife has the right to decide not to be in a marriage with you, and a therapist can help you accept and move through this change that has broken your heart and left you lost. You dont indicate why you havent seen your child, and you may want to consult with a lawyer about the laws in your area and how to gain access to your baby. Therapists dont intervene in these ways. The marriage may be ending, but your role as a loving father is only beginning. You can focus on giving your child the gift of two parents who respect each other."
"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?","The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You dont have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people whats wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the selfdoubt and hurt feelings. No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry. This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage."
"I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. During that time I was a general manager. I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. But things began to change. He emotionally and sexually drained me. I lost my spirit. I used to be a very happy person but now I am a loner. I left him and moved to another state. Currently, Im working as a server which makes me believe less in myself. I feel pity for myself a lot but dont know what to do. When I have money problems, he does not help me. He actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life. I need help.","Congratulations on leaving your marriage!It is ok and natural to feel sadness, loss, uncertainty in direction, hurt, resulting from ending the marriage.Possibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelings.Be kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your ex.There is very, very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathy.More likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate you.Maybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotions.You were a manager once, you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing so.Good luck!"
I always feel like Im not good enough and it literally is so hard living. I dont know how to talk to my parents about it.,"Are you a teen? This is a really hard problem for more teens and adults than let on. When I was about 15, I remember asking my parents friend, Herman, whether life gets any easier when you get older. He said the problems are actually harder, but you gain the ability to deal with them better. Ive been an adult a long time now, and that is so true.If you need someone to talk to, consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect, maybe in church. If theyre good and they dont know how to help you, they may know how to get you to someone who can. Also, the idea of not being good enough is a common psychological event. In CBT its called a core belief, but I call it a core lie in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human. If you are serious about changing yourself, read about it at www.LivingYes.org and pick up a copy there or on Amazon. I hope this was helpful.

Depression is a common symptom of PTSD, but depression can come from many other sources as well. In the end, diagnoses are systems of behavioral labels.

I am always down and out. Could this be postpartum depression?,"Probably. I always tell the new parents I work with and this is just as true for dads as it is for moms that if you are feeling off, seek help.

"My last relationships have ended horribly. They just up and abandoned me. One of them I have never gotten closure with over it, leaving me emotionally wrecked. I know somethings wrong with me but I dont know how to even start trying to better myself. I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me. I know that I shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy, but I feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me.","Frequently when working with clients, I utilize the ABC model developed by Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an exampleA Action or Event You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B Behavior or Response You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C Consequence You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such asA stays the same.B this is what you change This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C Decreased feelings of depression overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend Feeling better, getting better, staying better by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone."
"I dont know whats wrong with me. At times I can be really happy, excited, Ill talk fast, and I want to do things. But lately Ive been staying up way later and sleeping too much. I dont hang out with friends, I dont really have them. I feel nothing, worthless. I want to do nothing, I have no interest in anything. All I usually do is stay in my room. I want to be happy, I want to be nice. Whats wrong with me?","Im sorry to hear that you are feeling as if youre in a slump. First of all, nothing is wrong with you. Many people report similar symptoms. Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms? Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder. I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them.Its possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues. If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help.Thanks for reaching out! I hope that you will feel back on track soon!"
"Ive have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?","The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors. This is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT.There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes. Another quote I like is You will find a way or you will find an excuse. Dont ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You can do it!"
Im in a state of depression right now. Who can I talk to? Ive been sick in a lot of pain and crying. Dont know where to turn.,"First of all, if youre sick and in pain, have you seen your doctor? If you have a chronic illness and pain, this can often lead to depression and is very common. Youve taken the first step to dealing with it. You can talk to your doctor, even if your depression isnt related to your health. He or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist.If thats not really an option for you, there arealso helplines local or national or support groups where people dealing withsimilar issuescan talk to each other. If you cant find any in your area newspapers usually publish this information, there areonline support groups as well."
"Ive been married for 3 years and I have two kids. During my 3years married, my husband cheated on me twice. The second time really got to me and at my lowest I hurt him back. We arent communicating as well as I would like. What do I do?","Hi there. Thank you reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help. I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can.First and foremost, you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man. Im going to assume there are. So, the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself, if you and your children are safe? Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming and going or currently living in the home, my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe i.e. family members home, friend or a shelter temporarily. I cannot stress this enough. Although, some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior i.e. they only do it when they are drinking, they only do it when they are mad, its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So, you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time. Its always better to be safe than sorry.Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children.Its unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however, that is no longer your concern. Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues. I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself."
"When Im in large crowds I get angry and I just cant deal with people. I dont really like other people I prefer animals they make me nervous and scared. I lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying, I have more conversions in my head than I do with actual people. I dont know whats wrong with me and why I feel this way. What should I do?","What you are experiencing is totally normal and these emotions mean you are human! Humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others, but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us.It is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past, maybe your family, or other traumatic interactions with others. It is also possible that they are caused by an underlying condition such as anxiety or depression, which may cause you to be more uncomfortable around others or annoyed by others. Some people are also more bothered by crowded spaces, loud interactions, and the actions of others.Of course you prefer animals me too!, they provide unconditional love and support, do not judge you, and do not require you to have conversations with them.The fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people, you are craving some social connection. What is probably the case is that you were never really taught how to interact and have those conversations. The good news is that there is nothing wrong with you, you just need a little help learning how to have these conversations and taking some healthy risks to initiate conversations and that is something that I help many of my clients with in therapy."
"Sometimes I cant stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. When I think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good, I feel overwhelmed. I dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. Am I crazy? I dont think these thoughts are normal.","You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown. Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety.Mindfulness based practices like meditation maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now rather than worrying about what happens after you die.Having said all that it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep. There are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety."
I get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex.,"Tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring, as well as listen to your specific worries and fears.Initiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sex.This way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion, not a prelude to sex.If you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner, then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined."
Ive been like this ever since I was in school back then I transferred to another school. Now Im thinking about changing my job.,"Theres a quote I love that says, Wherever you go, there you are and the book by the same name by Jon KabatZinn may be very helpful for you. The thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing. The awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention, you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be. Through this deeper work, you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself. If you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist, Id recommend looking for someone offering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT or MindfulnessBased Cognitive Behavioral Therapy MCBT. Also helpful may be the online program of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction MSBR found here.There are inperson programs across the country, but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource!"
I know this fear doesnt make sense. How can I overcome it?,"No, it makes sense Consider today how social media has impacted the mind and heart of manIs it not so extraordinarily easy to make one appear stellar on social media today? Heh heh, Ive long since joked that the definition of a party is A series of photos to lie with.When I peel back the awareness of others judgment, what I find is excitement of wanting to express themselves too...Its funny how America is one of the few lands on the planet where folks are able to mess up and try it again on most other places, if you mess up, there is such deep shame in it, that it may lead to one taking ones life"

"Im dealing with imposter syndrome in graduate school. I know that by all accounts I am a phenomenal graduate student, and that I am wellpublished. I am well liked by students and faculty alike. And yet I cannot shake the feeling that Im going to be found out as a fraud. How can I get over this feeling?","It sounds like you are on the right track. Recognizing these nagging thoughts of self doubt as imposter syndrome is a huge step in the right direction. From what you have written here, it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome. Continuing to remind yourself of what you have accomplished and looking at the facts at hand can help diminish doubt. Remember, many successful people battled imposter syndrome on the way to the top and still manage it. It might be helpful to read some of their stories so that you dont feel alone. The Cut has a great article on 25 Famous Women on ImposterSyndrome and SelfDoubt. Business Insider has a great article about men and the imposter syndrome too. Remember, if you jumped through all of the hoops to get into school and get published you belong."
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Hello. First, I am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,your continued dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This isYOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 510 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and areincredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. Wishing you the very best!Laura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC"
Im 17 and Im sick and tired of going back and forth. Id like to stay at my mothers house. This problem has really affected me. Ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and selfharm in the past. Currently Im going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. How do I handle this?,"Sounds like a lot is going on right now at such a young age. Id start with discussing with mom your concerns and ideal situation. Im unsure what prevents you from staying there, but whoever you are staying with, it should be brought to their attention. In regards to your anxiety attacks, deep breathing is always a benefits. I have a link you can use to help to do this online if you are interested. In addition, finding ways you usually cope with anxiety and whats worked before can help and if it isnt, exploring new way to calm you down can be beneficial. This is something you can speak with your therapist about going forward when they are available.In regards to feeling suicidal I would call suicide prevention hotline You can google them if you truly feel the ideation is getting worse. They are professional agents who can speak with you about your ideation and help you through the process. Hope this helps."
"When Im around people, I sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something. I will be focusing on something else and then randomly think I hear something about me. I never know if it was actually said.","Anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you. When we are on high alert, we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature. To some extent this is normal, for example, when people experience late onset deafness, they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that. Of course, Im not saying you are going deaf or anything, just giving an example. Counseling can help you work through this anxiety. It may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on. Sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety, which is a very distressing experience. But both are absolutely treatable. Wishing you the best!"
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. Its gotten so bad that I first wake at 430, then 445, and finally stay awake by 600. Im always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest Ive went without sleep is three days.","That is awful! I am sure you are ready to start getting some rest. Its normal for us to wake a few times in the night, however, when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress, those times can turn into being up most night. Given that you are having these repeated dreams, I am wondering what might be going on in your life either now or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories. It can help to draw the dream out in the morning or even to look for metaphor. In the long run, seeking counseling can help you sort all that outIn the meantime, selfsoothing strategies may help you in the night when you wake and cant get back to sleep. This can be anything with your sensesgetting a snack like tea and focusing on that taste, smelling something pleasant, listening to some relaxing music, looking through a magazine, taking a shower. Anything you can think of that might help you relax. If it involves needing to get up, thats okay! Getting out of bed can actually help you get out of that mind space and helps you associate your bed with relaxationsleep vs anxiety making it more likely you will fall asleep once you lay down."
"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. Im not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to. I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I dont know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?","Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard! It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called SelfHelp for Anxiety Management. Theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful, and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety. The best part is, its free!"
"I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act? I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out.","From your writing, you have already atoned for what you describe as cowardly.Recognizing your action and trying to directly correct it, realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action, are all examples of making things right.Since the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter, you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view."
"Ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week. I cant sleep. I get a sense of doom, and its hard to breathe. I feel like nothing I do makes it better.","Anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset, attach themselves.Try to understand more about who you are, what you like, feel uneasy about, especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful people.Anxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long ago.Once you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease. This is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others."
"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if Im in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say whats wrong with me. When my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong, I never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me.","Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughts.Try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom.Also its possible you simply dont feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize youre better off not talking with them about a delicate matter.Depending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom, you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourself.Theres no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you dont feel are willing to accept or understand who you are."
I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job. People keep telling me I have anxiety and Im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?,"Anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable. The concern that I can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all and that can become a problem, indeed.As opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you, it could be helpful to start breaking it down. What are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job? Is it being away from your family? If so, why?Once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls, then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue."
"I recently broke up with my boyfriend After being together for over 4 years. I truly believe I did the right thing, but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself. I am seeing someone casually and I am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation. How can I learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?","Hello. What you are experiencing is entirely reasonable for someone that is still trying to adjust to a new life and also leave behind a long term relationship. It sounds like you lost touch with who you were as a person and need to start exploring that side of you again. Spend time doing things that you have been putting off, or did not do because you were involved. Take the time to become one with yourself before you get into another serious relationship. Regaining selfconfidence on yourself will help you with all other areas of life. It is time to make you a priority and to start focusing on your mental and physical well being. Get connected with your community and find things you would want to do that give you purpose and lift you. Before too long you will be in your way to being content and in total control of your mind and at peace. Best of luck. Mirella"
"Im a teenager, and while Ive never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot.","Despite your anxiety you are highly attuned to your sense of well being and skillful in articulating the details of when anxiety takes over.Sometimes people who anxious in specific realtime situations are helped by talking themselves through the anxiety.Maybe youd be able to distract yourself from the grocery store anxiety by telling yourself youre anxious and that youll be ok, its only a grocery store.The longer term way to dissolve anxiety is through selfacceptance, selflove, selfbelief, basically all the areas of trusting yourself to handle situations.Anxiety is a fear of being overwhelmed by a circumstance or condition which ends badly for you.Often the person can very well handle the situation about which theyre anxious. The problem is not trusting themselves enough to rely on their self knowledge."
"I am a really shy person. Im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","Wow, congratulations on being in a masters program. You are in a unique place. So few have reached that level. You should give yourself a pat on the back.Confidence is not something that comes naturally. But can and does come with practice.Having gone through two masters programs I can sympathize with your your dilemma.So how is the stress affecting you?Is it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just butterflies?There are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress. Much depends on how serious the stress is.So here are a few ideas1. Practice in front of a mirror.Sounds strange but the practice helps.2. Ask some friends to listen to your presentations.Not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting.3. Focus on the material you are presenting.The subject matter is what you want to get across. Step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present. Let the material you present be the focus.4. Remember everyone else is just as nervous as you.Share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them. Focus on a friendly face during the presentation. Be a support to them in return.5. Fake it, till you make it.Yes it sounds blunt.But sometimes thats what it takes. Even if you feel like it, you wont die.So much more can be discussed with a competent counselor. Take the time to let a professional help you work through this.Again you have come a long way to be in a graduate program. Congratulations you have done great work so far. Its just one step at a time, take the steps."
"I start counselingtherapy in a few days Im freaking out but my main fear is that Ill cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Oh, crying in therapy is very normal! I have a stack of kleenex boxes in my office. Cry away, therapist are very used to it First time being in therapy is scary, but youll soon know if you are a good match."
I feel too scared to meet people I dont know even relatives. I dont ever raise my hand or talk in school. I feel like no one understands. How can I handle this?,"Social Anxiety is scary. You dont feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world. Is it something you can talk to your parents about?A school counselor could help you. The counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to help.Build your self confidence Start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation. Its important to start finding things in common with others. You dont need to carry the conversations, just add a phrase or two. Have an exit strategy if you get too uncomfortable. Keep notes of what worked and what didnt work so youll be prepared for your next opportunity. Carpe Diem!"
"Im a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because Im trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they dont know that Im suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think Im a threat because of it. Im not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and dont know why Im so scared to be around them. I dont understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","In our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children physically or sexually. As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as paranoia sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on further assessment by the right professional would determine this, the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose,rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."
"Ive known him for about six years. Weve dated off and on. I hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally. If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldnt really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone."
"Example would be homecoming? I was at my high schools home football game on Friday, and I left because I felt uncomfortable with all the people there and I just wanted to be by myself. Why is that?","Hi! Im Amelia. Oh, that is so frustrating! Have you ever heard of social anxiety? Sounds like you may be suffering from it. Here is a link to a quiz... being a therapist, I am a Mom to 10 kids. A couple of my kids are very uncomfortable with crowds and become very anxious. Find yourself a therapist who can assess you and spend time with you to address these issues and to help you learn tools to help you navigate these emotions.I am wishing you the best!"
"I am a female and in my early teens. I dont want to feel afraid of people. When I meet someone, I know that they are okay, but I still feel afraid.","Maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other people!Reflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trust.If youve had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated, emotionally, physically or through some terrible accident or incident, then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be feared.Give yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people, eventually you will succeed."
"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him. I also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally, physically, and emotionally. Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people. How can I feel more comfortable around other people?","Theres a lot of layers there to your situation, and Im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others. One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism. Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis. The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around. Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful. Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt. If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist. A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in. The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others. Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process, as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships."
"Sometimes, Im fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder. There isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, whats going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general.Anxiety itself is a really natural thing its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual. Working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms. This twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like."
"A lot of times, I avoid situations where I am to meet new people because I have a fear of embarrassing myself. I often avoid large groups of people, like parties, because I think they all constantly judge me.","Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue.Everyone, atsome point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment. But for manypeople, this fear can becomeso awful that it begins tohave a real negative impact on their quality of life.They willtry to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventuallylead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear.I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others. The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over, but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently. A colleague may offer some other advice, as well.. Be wellRobin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"My partner lives in Canada while I live in the US. We visit each other, but we go months in between visits. I have anxiety, and Im always anxious about him cheating or still having feelings for an ex that he dated for three years. He doesnt understand my anxiety. How do I stop myself from worrying so much?","Would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a couple?Long distance relationships are not for everybody. Some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel secure.The question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationship.Anyway, cheating has nothing to do with distance since married people cheat while living together for years under the same roof!"
I just about fall asleep then I cant help but sit up and walk around.,"Maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hours.Although you didnt write this, usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their lives.If this describes you then. maybe talk with yourself to convince you that you are entitled to a good nights sleep.Really we all are and feeling rested from the day and lifes tensions will better you to handle whatever the particular matters are.Also, maybe you will be more enthusiastic to go to bed if you have a comfy mattress and nice pillows! Make your bed an inviting place because this will tempt you to enjoy relaxing enough to go to sleep!"
I have severe anxiety and have tried everything. Everything makes it worst.The only thing that helps is my emotional support animal.,"Sorry to read of your suffering.Is it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to school?I see your point of the animal helping you. I just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander, or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroom.You may end up feeling worse, if when you bring your support animal to school, that it disturbs people or interferes with the routines of the class.For your anxiety, I suggest some loving kindness toward yourself. Be patient with yourself and that you have anxiety. If youre able to accept that some situations create great discomfort for you, maybe youll tolerate these difficult situation.Embrace your anxiety as part of you, basically, rather than trying to banish it, which because it actually is part of you, is impossible to achieve.In a way, Im suggesting you become your own support animal. Love yourself, be kind to yourself, and see if you feel a little less stressed in school."
"Im just an extremely paranoid person. I constantly feel as though I am in some sort of danger, like as though I live in a horror movie with no resolution. It worsens at night. It gets to the point Im scared in my own home more so than anything. I have no access to the help I need so Im desperate.","One approach is to be more accepting of yourself as someone who has fears.It is much easier to manage a problem when youre not fighting yourself for having a problem.Once you are willing to accept this quality within yourself you may start to feel a little more relaxed about handling the fears when they arise.One answer is to examine the facts about the fears. Ask yourself fact based questions as to how you would handle the worse case scenario of your fears.Feeling prepared, whether or not the circumstance is highly unlikely to happen, may increase your peace of mind with living the great fears within your mind."
"I dont know if Im normal. Im really scared to touch a girl. Im a young adult and a virgin. My fiance and I want to have sex soon, and this might mess everything up because she wants a baby soon as well.","Your question is a good one!The best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it. Eventually shell find out, and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens you.Also, she may feel similar to you, who knows?Discussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy. And emotional intimacy has a lot to do with feeling at ease with physical intimacy."
I dont understand why this is happening. Why do I feel this way?,"The short answer I could give is that we dont know why its happening. The longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears, or anxieties, that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside. But any sort of exploration about this almost HAS to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings, thats its not something to be ashamed of. If we are ashamed of any of our behaviors, then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from.This could be something that can be worked through in therapy, and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically, agoraphobia."
"I am a peaceful person, but I often find myself having thoughts about killing people. Eventhough I like the thoughts at the time, they make me cry. Why do I feel like this?","Maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware exists.Sometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others, imagine if they do the opposite of love, which is to kill, that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving way.This is my theory, it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamic.Most important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings, including the ones which are uneasy, such as killing, to consider."
I shake and have panic attacks.,"One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourself.The insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic.One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life. When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention, then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them. This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed in.A simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactions.To know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life!"
I havent been feeling like myself lately. Ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious. Im feeling burnt out. What can help me feel better?,"Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? Where you first said, Ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious, you then say that you are feeling burnt out, which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason. Perhaps you are feeling burnt out! That is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! When we get burnt out, I have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont, doesnt really matter once we get into doing too much.If either of those rings true for your experience, try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from. I wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website. I dont want to do shameless promotion, but I thought it could also add to helping you hope that you can also see that its not an abnormal experience."
"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I dont know how. What can I do?","Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance Ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said Im scared of snakes, I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C"
"I dont remember when the voices in my head started, but I remember Hearing them when I was little. I know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own. I fight the voices and I want them to stop. Theyve been here so long and I want them gone. How can I make the voices stop?","How is your life going overall?Since you hear voices since you were young I wonder whether you mean the thoughts each of us has about what to do, our opinions, including selfcriticism and praise.I try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if youve managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voices.Usually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychotic.Since this is going on for a number of years, I wonder if the problem is something different."
"Ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I dont exactly know why, I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now Ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I dont know how to stop or even why Im doing it. How can I help myself to change my behavior?","Give yourself a lot of empathy and care for having had a rough childhood and realizing that life can be better than how you were treated when growing up.Be patient with yourself too bc lasting change takes time.Alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors, or if youve discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment, time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels natural.Anxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their lives.Anxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid. Allow yourself to learn who you truly are in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourself.The behaviors will naturally change with your new understanding and self acceptance.Good luck and enjoy this self discovery project!"
"I have several issues that I need to work through. However, I am afraid of and do not trust therapists after a horrible experience. Im dealing with grief and guilt over losing my sons due to drug use. I have a very complicated traumatic relationship issue that is causing me severe anxiety and fear.","I am sorry that you had this experience. Therapy should be a healthy positive experience off g growth.You have the right to look for certain high qualities in a therapist and finding the right one. Each therapist is bound by a code of ethics and clients should have high expectations. You are trusting them to guide, support and help you achieve the absolute best outcome and success.You should never be or feel judged, and you should feel comfortable and feel as though your therapy process is moving along with YOUR GOALS IN MIND.Speaking as a therapist, I encourage my clients to always let me know how they feel, even if they disagree with me, they also have the right to inform me if something Im doing simply is not working for them, communication is critical in maintaining a healthy therapeutic alliance therapeutic relationship.Im able to offer ways of thinking and strategies to my clients they may not have thought of. Its important to listen to my clients.

Why am I so afraid of it? I dont understand.,"Your fear is somewhat reasonable. No one wants to be raped and I imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel like.Do you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would like?If this is the case, then try understanding the reason behind your fear.Is it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped? One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe. The more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking, isolated physical surroundings, and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar, probably your fear will decrease.The other general direction to understand is if in your family history, people have been violated severely, either emotionally, mentally, or physically.In families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves, often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others, plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generation.Its possible then, that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own suffering.The good news is that individual therapy, with a credentialed and licensed therapist, is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden."
"I have attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger, and memory problems. I cant work. I have no income. Im on medicine, but I feel worthless. I want to be normal.","I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling. It sounds like youve had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways. Without knowing much about your history, I wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety, anger, and memory problems you are dealing with, in addition to PTSD. I would encourage you to look for a trauma therapist who offers a sliding scale or pro bono services. There may also be community mental health services in your area that offer free therapy if you are eligible for grant."
"I never feel like myself. I cant even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I cant remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I dont know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","Hi Houston, Okay, somethings definitely going on, right? My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms. While it seems anxiety is a likely problem here, your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy. Without knowing more, thats all I can say at this point. Best of luck."
"I had to put a restraining order against my exfianc. He was served last night. He was mentally and verbally abusive towards me. I thought it was my nerves, but every time I stand up, I get sick. If I sit and rock, Im fine.","Hello, and thank you for your question. You may be right, your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomachmay very well be your nerves or anxiety. That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances. Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock. That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress. If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms, you may want to visit your primary care provider. They may tell you that they dont see anything physically wrong with you, and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience. A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way. I work as a counselor in primary care, and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse. Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common. Sometimes, with counseling, those physical symptoms actually stop. Be well, and I hope you feel better soon.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC"
"Ive been dealing with this for years. My mom thinks Im overly emotional and refuses to offer any help, like therapy or seeing a doctor. Shes seen me when Im having a panic attack and just said I was faking for attention or that Im a hypochondriac. I just want to get better.","I dont know how old you are, but in Pennsylvania, if you are over 14, you can have therapy without your parents consent. If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well. If transportation is a problem, call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistance.In the meantime, try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live. They may be able to help you figure out where you can get help.Another idea is that if you are in school, your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help. He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacks.I know you said your mom refuses to offer help, which included seeing a doctor, but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician also called a family doctor who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication. That doctor may be able to help you as well.Some of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one. This may give you other information to speak with your mom about. Remember that Im not asking you to actually diagnose yourself with one of these things, but just offering some basic information that may help you be able to talk about what is going on.If you are having a panic attack or having a moment of anxiety, try focusing on different things in the room around you. It may help to shift your focus briefly outside of what you are feeling and that may lessen the feeling a bit. Also remember that sometimes anxiety leads to more anxiety about having a panic attack in the future. Remember that they usually and after a few minutes.It would also be helpful for you to keep track of what leads up to your anxiety.Best wishes to you and keep trying until you get connected to someone."
"Ive been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasnt been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking Im abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? Im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think youre abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs dont do anything helpful in solving lifes problems. Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs? The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you."
"I am so terrified of having sex anymore because I have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection. My partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex, and honestly, I want to give that to her.","I would suggest possibly talking with a physician about all the different types of protection. They may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are available.It sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns. Perhaps until you have the chance to speak with someone about the effectiveness of different contraception and forms of protection, are either of you open to other forms of engaging in sexual intimacy without penetration, but with use of vibrators, toys designed for sexual interactions, etc.?"
"I was in a car accident and totaled my car. I gave up my job of nine years to pursue school fulltime to better myself. I failed a class, and my boyfriend that I live with thinks Im stupid and wants to break up with me. I have nowhere to go, and I feel like Im losing everything.","When we feel overwhelmed by life situations, it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from. Once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.First, car accidents are common, and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us. When we have an accident we feel anxious, worried, and may have some trauma after the accidents. If you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident, talk to your doctor or therapist about it. Second, a lot of people fail classes, tasks, deadlines, etc. but they dont give up on their goal. We have to remember that failing is part of the learning process, and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character. Remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job, and the courage and determination that took to do so, then channel that energy back into school. Third, when we have problems in our relationships, is helpful to look for ways to improve communication, discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them, but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isnt enough interest in one of the parts or if theres verbal or emotional abuse. Consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communication.At all times focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem increase selfcare activities, do more things that you enjoy, meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life. At the end, you are the one in control of your life, and you determine who you become.Qu puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida est fuera de control?Estuve en un accidente de auto, y fue prdida total. Deje mi trabajo de 9 aos para completar un grado a tiempo completo. Falle una clase, y mi novio piensa que soy estpida, el quiere dejarme. No tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todo.Cuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones. Ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio, es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron, y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vida.Primero, los accidentes de auto son comunes, y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas. Cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos, preocupados, y puede que experimentemos algn trauma. Si sientes ansiedad, extrema preocupacin habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto. Segundo, muchas personas fallan clases, tareas, fechas de entrega, pero no se rinden. Tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje, y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo, es lo que nos da determinacin y carcter. Recuerda que te impuls a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energa en la escuela. Tercero, cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones, es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias, pero puede ser que la relacin termine si no hay inters mutuo o si hay algn tipo de abuso. Considera hablar con tu novio y establecer lmites respecto a la comunicacin apropiada.En todo momento enfcate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima, aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien, medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa ms tiempo practicando esas actividades."
Its especially bad at night time. I am scared of sleeping alone.,"Being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it, is the first step to addressing and handling it!Generally, anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life.Somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt insecure when very young.Usually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonable.Their inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young, hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable, even if this takes some practice.Try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown person.Also, sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely. This loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now, felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address."
"I am on the track and softball team. My school is small, so I play all four sports it offers. I feel obligated to do track because Im not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.","Does anyone notice that you get sick and cry on track meet days?Have you told anyone?From what you write, as much as you would like to please your school and dad, something within you doesnt quite want to fully follow through.Step one in life always is to know what you want and what your limits are. It already is difficult to avoid listening to your body.Try understanding what is difficult in telling your father that youd like doing as he wishes, only are not able to do so because you are emotionally and physically distraught on the days you have track.After finishing the season for this year with your schools track team, then expect to concentrate on taking care of your own need to not do track.Hopefully your father will understand and care about your problem. If he does not and track is more important than your well being, then you have a different problem entirely."
"Im socially awkward. Ive always want to be popular. Ive had the opportunity to be popular, but every time I get i,t Im too scared. All I have to do is talk the popular people. Theyre really nice to me, but Im too scared of change. I really want to work up the courage to lose my fear.","Change can be uncomfortable, but sometimes those uncomfortable moments are the opportunity for us to be the person we feel we really are. It sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst, why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay. By telling yourself it will not be okay, or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want. Give yourself some credit for being awesome and tell yourself you can build new friendships...it may be the motivation you need to move past this fear."
"I often get the feeling that Im being watched, like video cameras are hidden wherever I am, even at home. I feel like people can see all that I do and are reading my thoughts. Things I read or hear on the radio seem to be about or meant for me, and people are talking about me when they whisper.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored, with no privacy even in your own mind, and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media. Its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience, but you may be able to get insight into that, as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way, with the help of a good therapist. There is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away, though it might, however, there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life."
I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.,"Thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency. Human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people, places, and things to let us know more about ourselves. We also have an inner voice, dialogue, conscience, etc. that helps us to determine the path for us. Often, when someone is worried about the external feedback, and focuses on this as the sole source of information, it can create a dependency that can become problematic. Balance is key to so many things in life. Your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek. Dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others."
I feel really uncomfortable when I have peoples attention. It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skillstechniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! And you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that talking to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but arent really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy arent ready to laugh at you. What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulnessanxiety help are important steps. Good luck!"
I have been having a lot of nightmares where I am being killed in different ways. I either wake up in a panic or just crying and sweating. It has made me terrified of falling asleep and is now affecting my daily life too. Can I make the nightmares stop?,"Hello, and thank you for your question. Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try 1. Have you changedor started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams dont always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areasand many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up Guided Meditation for Sleep exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search Nightmare Rescripting or Nightmare Exposure you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. We go to different schools, and we dont see each other that often. I just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me.","Have you spoken to him about your fears? Perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure. Also, it is important to trust your intuition! Perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned. It may not be paranoia it may be based in reality!"
"Im concerned about my boyfriend. I suffer from anxiety, but I always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in BDSM intercourse. We havent tried it, but Ive had this feeling he always wants to.","Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few thingsthat people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feelconnected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, ifwe feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. I dont know the specifics about your relationship or howcomfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of thosesituations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception tothat would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If youbelieve that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds likethere is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the casethen remaining safe is your top priority. Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings,telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriateand sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable forall parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say no toabsolutely anything they are not comfortable with. I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, sextrust. Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means theywont degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing orcoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. Your personal safety and mental wellbeing iswhat is most important. Now, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSMand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that youcan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articlesare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, butagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It isalso important to know that BDSM is notjust one thing and people practice itdifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it.I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"I get so much anxiety, and I dont know why. I feel like I cant do anything by myself because Im scared of the outcomes.","This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex. Depression, low selfesteem, fears. To decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious. For example I dont need to worry, I am calm and relaxed. 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex. deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful. Keep in mind, a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement."
"I started dating my fianc two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancs sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries. Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mothertakes the issuesto you. I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation. Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships. Triangulation istwo individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.From someone who has dealt withboththese issues ona personal level,being informed aboutfamily dynamics is beneficial and can helpyou develop healthy boundaries for yourselfwithin your family structure. You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries. Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time. Hope this help!"
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get lightheaded, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reactionwhich is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, theautonomic nervous system called the autonomic response. This systemis responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rateas well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe. It is largely an unconscious function, butwith training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which youprepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepareand cope for larger presentations. One of the greatest applications ofaddressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situationsthey will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that whenit does happen not if but when that they are able to move through thechallenge with success. You can learnmore about his by going to TED Talks What I learned about going blind in space It isa truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal withit. With that being said, finding a programlike a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help. Working with a counselor who can help youutilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you canalways talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there aswell. Good luck!"
"I am a teenage girl. Ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I dont remember anything about this dream. I still know that its the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?","There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember."
"Ive been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it wont last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics. See if you relate to those characteristics. I have a feeling you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly. For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss. Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.
"I started seeing this guy that I met at a mutual friends place. He recently broke up with his exgirlfriend and started seeing me. Everything was great in the beginning, then I started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his exgirlfriend again. Its all I think about. I am still seeing him, but things have changed because I am at a loss for words. I get stuck in my own thoughts. I like and care for him a lot. He just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies.","Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts. As you stated, everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking. What is contributing to these negative thoughts? His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question.."
"I have not had a friend since I was 19. I dont go anywhere, and I have no job, all because Im afraid of people.","Individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety. Often in therapy, the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety, in a sensitive way, and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want. In group therapy, you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist, but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another."
"I feel insecure in my life. I dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. I have had a drinking problem for a few years. I feel the reason I drink is not just because I like to, but because I have lately been on edge. Ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that I have been watching for years. Im paranoid about driving on main roads. Im very jumpy at the slightest noises.","Given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. First and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. There are however, ways to address this. As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model DBT which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. Mindfulness, another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. Well worth looking into.Seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist. This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away. Think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound. The same applies here. Think of it as first aid for the mind."
"I think Im annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says Im just fine. I dont think so, I think Im stressing everyone else out","I think you have identified something important here. Its not unusual to experience feelings that dont seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes.In this case, it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome. Despite knowing that people like you, it seems that theres still a part of you that feels like youre a bother.Finding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need."
"Im a little paranoid. My mind does get the best of me. One night, I put chairs under all of my door knobs because I thought someone might break in. I also think a lot, which is probably the reason for the paranoia. I cant stand loud noises, like the sound of cars going by. The grocery store is too noisy, and I feel like people are looking at me.","Paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid. They believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threats.From what you write, you are aware that your actions may be understood as extreme.Instead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category, try seeing each of the behaviors you list here, as your own uniqueness.This way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendencies.If you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet, then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid, it is simply the way of who you are.One possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself. They may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream. From what you describe, you already are dealing with what you call paranoia."
"When I go to school, I feel like everyone is judging me, even my friends. I get overwhelmed which these thoughts and sometimes cannot get out of what I call a deep hole of thoughts. I barely go to any of our school dances because of all of the people. Not even when I am completely alone do these thoughts go away. I still feel like people can see me and are judging me.","It sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged, even when alone. It sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you. Many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds, which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like, such as leading them to isolate. In therapy, you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships."
"Recently, I had a close call after delivering my second child blood clot followed by internal bleeding and several blood transfusions. It was a close call. I am currently undergoing medical treatment because of the event, and I am constantly afraid the whole ordeal will happen again. I have never really had anxiety in the past, but I find now that it consumes my every day and night. With two beautiful children to raise, I am most terrified of not being able to raise and protect them.","Hi Meriden, its natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear. This fear is helpful to some extent, because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health. You can say thanks very much to fear for trying to protect you, and then you can take steps to reduce it. Right now, fear is working overtime and stealing your quality of life. You can work to put it into perspective.I invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you dont need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be. Imagine that fear is in front of you. Its saying hey, you need me! If I wasnt keeping you alert, you would be very ill. Fear doesnt trust you to take care of yourself.What is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence? What is the evidence that this wont likely happen again it was specifically connected to the stress of labour, right?. What is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur? What is the evidence that you are healing? What is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence? What is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you, not help you? How many hours of your life do you want to hand over to fear?Fear is trying to keep you safe, but you can turn the volume down by talking to yourself about all these things. I wish you well."
"I constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff. Its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious. I dont sleep because Im thinking about something I can get rid of. I dont know why I do it. I started years ago when I lived with my dad then I stopped when I moved in with my mom. Years later, it has started again.","Since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived, would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent?Play in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this. Are you feeling alarmed or freed, by throwing away things? Im only suggesting these, not telling you that they apply necessarily.Anxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives. So pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years. Possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parent.Basically, sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are, once all the clutter is released."
"I met a guy a while ago, and I cant stop thinking about him. I feel like I love him, but I dont think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is? I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. I dont know, am I too obsessive? Every time we talk though, its like magic. He makes me feel amazing, but what if Im mistaken?","Keller, it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind, instead of in the real world. You can get answers to your questions by talking to him...getting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have. Youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship.So what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him? Fear of rejection? Fear of something else? If you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships, I recommend a therapist to help you work through that. I wish you well."
"Ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder. Lately, Ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago. All of a sudden, I dont feel as comfortable around him as I used to, although I cant seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way.","How is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him?Has he told you that hes noticed changes in you?The good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person. Doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship. Given that the two of you recently moved in together, it is natural for new dynamics, feelings and expectations to arise. It just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you.Psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills. Very often, just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are.Anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed.It is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters. Be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you. Youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations. Keep the label of being disordered, aside. Psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives."
"My toddler defies everything I say and doesnt see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. Id like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.","Hi Biddeford,This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to theres a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and thats healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. Ill give you some tips.First, remind yourself that its her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Dont be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, were less caught off guard when it happens.Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter do this now, you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that shes young enough you can pick her up now is the time to teach her that moms or dads word means something. So, if you say lets get you dressed, then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And Im talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Heres an example...shes on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says no. You can say ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you dont play it later. The choice is hers. Then follow through.When...then statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack. Youre simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it.Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use selftalk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!"
I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. Im having bad flashbacks. Im scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I dont leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"Im sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, youll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!"
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. Im worried that, at this rate, I wont have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal. Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","Hi Winters, Im so glad you wrote, because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel selfloathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you cant be both, so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language.This current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt, and loneliness. I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they dont fit in. We are all different, and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are. You dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.Youre tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but hes out there. The question is How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path?I hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. I wish you the best."
"For my whole life, Ive been very unconfident, insecure, and selfquestioning. Im super quiet because Im scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like Im doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because Im too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down. Im in my early twenties, and I really need to create a better life for myself. Ive been like this for so long, so how do I change?","One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves. Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries. Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries. In effect, assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation. One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, The Assertiveness Workbook How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships by Randy J Paterson."
"I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. Im also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do?","Hi there. I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling. A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be.First off, what stressors do you have in your life right now? Financial, relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all.Secondly, do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family? Some of the symptoms listed here in this question i.e. trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, too much sleep, anger anxiety are all common symptoms of depression. Often times, these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for just being tired.Furthermore, its important to ask yourself, if you are feeling worthless, problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. If you are having these symptoms, please seek help IMMEDIATELY.Lastly, considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult. Its always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better! do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits i.e. how much or little are you sleeping, make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks.I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you."
"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I cant continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 45 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you."
"Im a teenager, and I struggle with going out and talking to people. I feel awful about leaving home. I know I cant afford a therapist so I dont know what my problem is, but I think I might have social anxiety.","If you are noticing that anxiety tends to be triggered around interactions with others, then you may have social anxiety. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into the nature of the anxiety, develop tools for coping with it, and take steps that may alleviate it over time, so that you can enjoy your interactions with others. If you are short on money, there still may be options for you to be able to see a therapist. Check with your insurance provider about your behavioral health coverage. If you have medicaidapple care, there are some private practice therapists who accept this form of insurance, as well as community clinics which do. If you are not insured, some therapists and clinics will work on a sliding fee scale, and accept either low fee or may even work with you probono for free."
"Whenever I dont tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff thats not really important, I feel terrible, like theres a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Selfharm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although Im glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon."
"I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that Im an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.","While anxiety can come about for many reasons, trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life. When we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come. This is normal, natural and in many ways helpful at least initially. This fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again. However, as it sounds like you know, anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety. In order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life, I would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online."
"I find myself being very outgoing most of the time, but there are some times when I dont know what to say. I dont even want to talk at all. Its like, I search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out. I dont know if Im outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say. I dont know if people like that about me. Im very selfconscious and always think people are talking about me, so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk.","Would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation, you simply listened attentively to the other people?This way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as well.Maybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focus.Start by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you are.Maybe you simply need new and different groups."
"This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.","Overwhelming fear, social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge. But there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this. So there is hope! In addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax, there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid. A good CBT therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts. Behavior is also important. Despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out, to do things that relax you maybe a yoga class or a meditation class?. Exercise. Diet. Eat well. Think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past, and force yourself to do these things again. I know that this seems hard, but it beats the alternative, doesnt it? Of course, I recommend you pick up a copy of my book, Living Yes, which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out. I hope you get unstuck soon!

I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to live life to the fullest! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a todo list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spousepartner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please dont hesitate to reach out for anything further!"
"My dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties, dinners, etc. Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down. My mom and everyone else behaves likewise. For my father who heads a company, this is normal. He has to be right all the time. He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle. Recently however, its been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind. It isnt possible for me to get professional oneonone help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing more severe body image and selfconfidence issues, which I have had all my life. I feel invalidated by my dad. I have been more paranoid lately as well. I cant turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He makes me feel guilty about it. I feel rather worthless more often than not, unfortunately. What do I do?",Im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents. It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment. I would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area. Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with them.If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents. Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enough.Good luck!
"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. Im taking medications to control them, but Im thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","Im sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I dont feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but its likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises.Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another."
I had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time. I have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety. Every medicine I have been on my body rejects I get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth. How can I calm my self down? Im a wreck.,"You didnt say what or how many medications youve tried. Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting Ohm to meditate. Its about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus and refocus and refocus. Like I said, it takes practice, so dont give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.I hope this helps and best of luck to you."
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. Im afraid its going to break her. I dont know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult. On a very basic level, There exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics food, shelter. water, safety as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes. This is where the ability to communicate with them, letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move, is so important. Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it."
"I have four children. One of them is in her 20s, and she cannot afford to go, nor can I pay for her. She went last year for two weeks by herself.","I imagine you are trying to figure out a way to be fair to your adult kids. The key word is adult. If your daughter can afford to join the family for a vacation thats great, shes welcome to come. However, as you pointed out she took a vacation by herself last year she chose to put her resources time off work and money into doing that. Good for her she did what she wanted. If she wants to budget time and money for a family vacation she will.As for feeling guilty, let me echo the sentiments already offered vacations are lovely, but not a survival need. Your girl is in her 20s and its her turn to provide for herself. You did your parenting now go enjoy your vacation with whoever can, and wants to, join you!"
Im being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like Im trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?,"All you can docontrol is work on yourself. When you have enough sense of self, you will know how to deal with your family. Therapy is an investment in yourself, which affects your family."
"When they come home from their dads and I fuss at them for anything, they move like they are dodging being hit. They say theyre sorry over and over really fast. I ask and they say no one has hit them, and Ive seen no marks. Am I being paranoid or am I right to be?","This sounds frightening and overwhelming, and Im glad you are reaching out for help. I cant say for sure your children are being abused but I can understand your suspicion since there appears to be a change your childrens behavior. I think it would be important for you to keep an eye on the situation Incase you notice any other changes. If you become more concerned, even suspicions of child abuse are reportable to Family protective services. If they feel it is necessary they can do an investigation. You are doing the biggest thing for your children by being there for them and supporting them."
"he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids. My fianc tells me it makes her angry and doesnt like it, but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason. Is it okay for him to do this?","The short answer to your question is No its not okay for anyone to ever be doing this.Theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention. Nevertheless, dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call 911. Ideally, yourfianc would be able to speak directly to her exhusband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements. The fact that shes afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior, and that she hasnt been able to give you any reason for her fear, suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors, entitlement, andor codependence. I hope things work out well for all and Im confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing."
My daughter is in later elementary school. She cant color in the lines. Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines.,"Depending on your daughters age, this could be a learning disability. I suggest contacting the school counselor and asking for an evaluation, once she is evaluated and depending on the diagnosis, she could be provided with treatment recommendations like occupational therapy, reading glasses, or assistance in class. These and more accommodations are enforced under the 504 act. Consider if the observations that you have done are affecting her performance in school only, or also in other settings. Observe her behavior and or her emotions and see if they change as well. Discuss these with your daughters counselor as well.Tiene mi hija un desorden mental?Mi hija est en la escuela elemental. Ella no puede colorear dentro de la lnea. Mezcla las palabras cuando escribe, a menos que tenga grandes espacios, o brinca las lneas.Dependiendo de la edad de tu hija esto puede ser un problema de aprendizaje. Te sugiero que contactes al consejero escolar y solicites una evaluacin, dependiendo de la diagnosis, ellos pueden recomendar tratamientos como terapia ocupacional, lentes para leer o asistencia en clase. Estos acomodos son provistos bajo la acta 504. Considera si las observaciones que has hecho afectan el desempeo de tu hija en la escuela, o en otras reas, tambin observa su conducta y emociones y reprtaselo al consejero escolar."
My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is. Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age. I dont know why this is happening. Is this normal?,"This is certainly an important issue tolook into, It is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childsdevelopmental history. Also, children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over, this can be as simple as a loss of a pet, a recent move, death in the family, andor as serious as sexual abuse, and other things. If you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point."
"My exwife married and used me to have a child. She now uses that child as a pawn. I know my child misses me, but I need to move on and not live in the past. How do I do this? Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?","You can move on and not live in the past in the context of your exrelationship, but that does not mean moving on from your child. Moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs development.Generally, its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child, but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress. That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child.Whats confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their expartner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to himher depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn. When dealing with a hostile expartner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your expartner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. If you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation. If thats not an option, then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which youd have to consult with an attorney."
"I am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism. We try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else. The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen, so we just talk in a calm voice. However, other kids see the treatment as unfair.","Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members.It is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not, to expect both sides to get along harmoniously.In order to achieve this, the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism.This would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isnt part of summer camp for children.What you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism, is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administrators.Ultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write, the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates."
"When my son was a teenager, we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude. A week after he graduated, his dad made him leave because of the same issues. All four parents tried to talk to him, and he just refuses help all around. He is now living with his grandparents. He had a job, and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle. I thought he was heading down the right road, and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it. I just dont know what to do.",Probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way hes handling himself.If youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talents.People are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of them.Offer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way.
"She cried because she lost all trust in me. Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed, what do I do?","You felt bad when you lied, so you told the truth. I imagine your mom was really shocked and upset both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person. Its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child, from whom she always assumed honesty, was capable of being dishonest. Thats not awesome, but its not the end of the world. You made a mistake youll make more of those in your life, just try not to make the same ones over and over again.It sounds like you and your mom are close so I can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you. Since you are a fundamentally honest person, the way back to being trusted is going to be simple, but may take a little time. The recipe is easy say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary, in which case you inform others involved, and repeat.And cut yourself some slack. Your mom will recover and so will you. Its an important and painful lesson about integrity, but once learned it will serve you well."
"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day not at night. She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat. She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health. I dont know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","That sounds awful, and is clearly unsustainable. There are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition. If all physical and mental health issues are ruled out, its time to take action. Get backup from friends or family members if you need to, but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice. She needs to find another place to live within that time. If she wants to stay with you, be clear that first she has to go, with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time. Once out, she can prove to you, and more importantly to herself, that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment. Remember, you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful if she is in good health, her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her."
"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. Its not the first time he has lied. I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know if I should punish him or make him do something. Ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?","A lot depends on the age of your child, but given that it was a misused debit card, I am going to guess hes a teen? Assuming that, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind...1. That he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong. Thats a dreadful feeling getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track.2. Once he lied he stuck with the lie. Somewhere along the line, even though he knew that you knew he wasnt telling the truth, he stuck with his story. And as you said, its not the first time he lied. Now it looks like a habit has formed.Going forward, when there is a dishonest act of any kind, its essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful. Simply put, do not ask questions. If you know for certain that he has, for example, misused your debit card, say so. Asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that, with a good enough reason, he might not be in hot water with you. Instead, say what is I see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission. You can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do.If he meets with denial, stay calm, restate that you are aware this happened. Then deliver consequences that match the transgression he has to return the item if its returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it. Make it harder to find your card because he isnt that great at curbing the impulse to use it yet.And most importantly, once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go. Continuing to bring it up wont benefit him, but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky. Every time he asks respectfully to use it, whether you allow him to or not, be sure to praise him for asking nicely. Catch him doing it right as often as possible.Hang in there this isnt super unusual behavior but it isnt acceptable, so address it but dont let yourself get too wound up about it."
"Im concerned about My 12 year old daughter. About a month or two ago she started walking on her toes, as well as coloring and writing very messy. This all happened very suddenly. She has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly. Is this something I should be concerned abou? Any advice will help.","It is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter. I cant offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think aboutHas something else happen recently that has been stressful, upsetting?Is your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that be?Have you discussed these recent changes with her? Without being too serious or accusatoryThere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial.I hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes."
I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?,"This is your experience, your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal, which means is this common or the rule.This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed etymology agitated or stirred up. Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right. So, though it might be normal common, the rule to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old, the dis turbance or stirring up in you,is important and requires your attention, your listening, if you will to your higher self."
"I was a single mom most of their growing up life and have guilt about trying to work three jobs and being gone a lot. My children are successful with their own businesss, have lots of nanny and cleaning help, but I just feel they have such a great opportunity to spend it with their kids.","You seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids lives.They may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single mom.I feel you are seeing your kids lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single mom.In other words, what you see your kids overlooking or not appreciating, may remind you of your wishes during the many years you raised your kids.If it helps you and is possible, then maybe you could spend more of your own time tougher with your grandkids. This may give some reward for the many years you spent working to support your kids and had no choice in the amount of time you had with your kids.As far as your kids relationship to their kids, it is now their turn to raise them as they wish, within ethical boundaries of course.Depending on the topics you and your kids talk about, consider to bring up your concern as to whether they feel their kids, your grandkids, are missing anything due to the limited time they have with the parents."
"Shes in her early 20s, and she has a toddler.","Well, first lets identify what factors are involved in the situation about which you wrote.Are you the only decision maker regarding your stepdaughter living with you?Is her dad, and your partner, living under the same roof?Would you feel any obligation to consult with your husband about his opinion and his way of handling the situation?Have you talked with your stepdaughter about your observation and your reaction to the fact of her not honoring your boundaries?Consider too that there will be an effect on the toddler, your grandchild, if you kick out your daughter.Is your daughter financially ready to live on her own and support herself and her child?You certainly have the right to define the terms of what goes on under your roof.It is only fair to everyone that as many variables as possible, be considered.The conclusion may be that it is in everyones best interest for your stepdaughter to move out.If everyone feels respected and a well thought out plan is developed, then the least amount of hurt and stress, and the most amount of happiness, will be possible from this change."
"My dad is always, and I mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. He makes me feel stupid. He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. Is this abuse?","Oh my goodness, my heart goes out to you!! I pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you. If you are in school, please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resources.I believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional AND verbal abuse. And quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having hisher emotions preyed upon as well.Healthy Placeoffers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describeYelling or swearingName calling or insults mocking.Threats and intimidation.Ignoring or excluding.Isolating.Humiliating.Denial of the abuse and blaming of the victim.And abuse survivor and author, Kellie Jo Holly, offers some other great examples of verbal abuseEmotionally Abusive StatementsYoure so cute when you try to concentrate! Look at you trying to think.I cant believe I love a stupid jerk.Aw, come on, cant you take a joke?Sexually Abusive StatementsYou should know how to please me by now.I hoped you were less experienced.Stop acting like a whore.Financially Abusive StatementsYou are going to nickel and dime me to death!In what world does buying that make sense?Fine. You handle your finances. Let me know when things go to hell.Societally Abusive StatementsHow dare you spread around our private business!Let me do the talking people listen to men.You took a vow in front of God and everybody and I expect you to honor it!Threatening and Intimidating StatementsIf you dont train that dog Im going to rub your nose in its mess.I will take our kids if you leave me.Youre scared?! This isnt angry! You will KNOW when Im ANGRY!Spiritually Abusive StatementKeep your stupid beliefs to yourself.God will find a way to get you back, and it aint gonna be pretty.I can feel myself being pulled into hell just listening to your nonsense!Its been my personal clinical experience that children who are experiencing the types of things you describe often say they feel misunderstood, lonely, or scared and dont want to make things worse by standing up for themselves.Even if you feel you cant defend yourself outwardly, that doesnt mean your fathers awful and toxic behavior is something you should ever internalize i.e., believe to be true which is why I hope you are surrounding yourself with people who will speak life and positivity back over you. We are ALL worthy of respect, love, and kindness. Dont ever forget that!My love and light to you hon.Tamara Powell, LMHC"
"My step nephew, a preteen, has begun masturbating. I also had to take away the internet because he was caught looking up porn. Im worried about him.","Your nephews behavior sounds normal and developmentally appropriate. Masturbation is a healthy expression of sexuality. Most families to create some rules about where its ok to masturbate for example, stating that it should be done in the privacy of the childs own room. Im wondering if you or another adult in his life have talked to him about his developing sexuality? It seems like that would help him and you handle his increasing maturity."
"We have tried gentle talking, counting to calm her and talking about it, sending her to her room and then trying to talk when shes calmer, and now calisthenics. However, nothing is working.","Theres two things this post relays one, which Im sure youve already looked into is working with the school to address this problem. Sure, sometimes kids dont get along, but most schools look at bullying seriously, and this sounds serious.The other, though, is additional tools to consider to help your daughter. If you havent already read Greenes Explosive Child, you might give it a shot. While its a little preachy, many of the tools are wonderful and can help parents navigate tantrums. Another tool that can redirect a child thats losing it is a task. If her tantrums, say, involve throwing things, maybe shes in charge of throwing all the sticks and acorns off the driveway into the garbage bin. Ie Hey Jenny, you seem really angry right now, lets use all that energy and get some work done! Go with her, throw with her, even if possible making a game out of getting the acorns into the bin from a distance.I wish you all the best"
I am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and Im behind on the bills. Ive been trying everything with no results. I feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine. I give intil it hurts and Im afraid that Im going to fail my babies Ive been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time. How can I get some support?,"Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life project.If your partner doesnt work or doesnt contribute his money to the household bills, then maybe you are eligible for some type of stipend from the government.Especially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you. Sometimes too, a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kids.Im glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids. This is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place."
My daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparents house. She wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself! We also have a new baby in the house i didnt know if this would contribute to this. How should I approach this?,"You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examine.Do you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episode?Is it possible the grandma abuses your daughter, or tells her scary stories, watches scary movies. These are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughter.Also, ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what killing herself means. Seven year olds dont have a concept of death being a forever condition. Seven year olds dont have a sense of future meaning besides likingdisliking them. Maybe the new baby is a factor. Do you feel this is a factor? Trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new baby.Even if she is, I doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action, including suicide."
"The birth mother attempted suicide several times while pregnant. The adopted mother was terminally ill upon adopting the baby and died when the child was just over one year old. The adopted father then remarried to a physically, psychologically, and emotionally abusive woman. The child was placed in foster care at 11 years old. What might be the long term effects on an adult with this childhood history?","The true answer is, no one can really say with certainty.The variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life. All anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guess.The only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go through.Some people become great teachers, therapists and philosophers who have this background. Some give up on life and hide away from others.The best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth."
My grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink Barbie backpack as a form of punishment.,"Parents are to teach discipline tochildren, not punishment. Punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt. There is a different in discipline and punishment.Punishment could have long term affects on a childs self image and growth. It can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well. Whatever your grandson has done, there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable. Punishment is not one them. Encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him, this way he will learn to respect and trust her. His actions would improve. She may need to attend a parenting class for blended families."
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone. My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?,"Hi! Im sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation. I have worked with a number of young adults in their 20s who have had to move back home after college , or even stay at home through the college years. Bottom line is that either way , it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be , to have to live at home. I have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home , they suddenly feel like a kid again . The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet , and I want to be respectful of you and our home at the same time , though, I feel like its important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous. Can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with ?If she is receptive , maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both . If this is too hard to do alone , perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of compromise contract. This is not an easy situation , but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned, structured discussion that doesnt take place in the heat of the moment , your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.Good luck !!Elissa Gross"
"My dad makes me feel like shit and like Im worthless. He calls me names and makes me feel depressed. I want to move out because I swear if I stay here, Im going to lose it. What can I do?","If youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life, then this is a reasonable choice.If youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad, then emotionally protect yourself from him.Doing so is much more difficult than maybe it sounds.Do you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dad?Also, limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize you.Are there other people who live in the household w you and dad?If yes, then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him?What do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you names?Is it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behavior?If yes, then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name calling.It is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stop.Not necessarily that he will stop. Knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own."
I want to live with my mom. My dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault. I still talk to my mom although My dad tells me that Im no allowed to. Im scared I will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me. How do I tell him that I want to live with my mom?,"Yes, from what you wrote, your dad doesnt accept responsibility for the way he feels and blames you for his feelings.Im glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young child.I also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishes.Your decision is not surprising since most people wouldnt want to live with a parent who shows little interest to respect their kids decisions.In terms of how to tell him your choice, do this in simple and most basic information terms. Ive decided for now to live w mom.I suggest to not offer reasons to him bc he doesnt seem interested in hearing them. Giving him reasons would likely trigger him to rebut them.If he asks questions, answer them as simply as possible.If and when you feel he is more willing to understand and know you, then youd feel more free to have genuine dialogue with him.Right now he doesnt seem very ready to handle this."
"I have three children a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. Im scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms. It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us. You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden. We are all in charge of the choices we make. No one makes us do something other than our self. We choose how we internalize and react to situations. I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward."
"She refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past. I dont know what to do. My daughter blames me and swears she hates me. My parents say I should just let my daughter live with her dad, but I dont see how I could fix things if I only see her every other weekend. What should I do?","Sorry to hear about your high degree of stress.How old is your daughter?Who abused yours daughter?The answers make a difference to your decision.Obviously if the father was the abuser, then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe, he will not abuse her, your daughter should stay with you.If someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter, then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one another.What does your daughter tell you she wants?Her wishes must be considered too.Relationships can be fixed. Sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other."
"Shes a teenager, and for the last two years, shes lived with her older brother. Shes angry because she wants to come live with me, but my current living situation is not the best for her. She refuses to see any reason. Shes being disrespectful. Her sexual curiosity is waking up.","Youre her mom and she needs you. I would suggest focusing on connection. Since you are not currently living together, one way to do this would be to plan a date in which she gets to decide what you do together. Give her time to think about what she wants to do. As long as the activity is safe and affordable, try to do it, even if its not your thing. While you are with her, turn off the phone and give her your undivided attention. The goal would be just for you to enjoy each other and connect."
"I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I wouldnt make her daddy die.","Children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately. It is also very likely that your daughter does not understand the permanence of death. Having said that, she is using some very specific ideas here and I would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children.I would also wonder where she is getting this idea. Sometimes children hear things on TV or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are remembering.It may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry, like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking for.Im curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry. Does she say the same sorts of things about you?It may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well."
"My husbands exwife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My stepdaughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husbands exwife has kept this information from my stepdaughters. The stepfather has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented. It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told. The exwife says her therapist says the opposite.",If the daughters are old mature enough to understand substance abuse. They should be told for their own empowerment. KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection.
"Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just dont know what to do anymore. She can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say.","I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with. Physical trauma is usually easier to identify, but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships, having experienced bullying, or some other emotional injury. The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through, and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning. I would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue."
Can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?,"I see a few issues hereFirst, the age of the child is important. If the child is considered anadult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this the range is typically between age 13 and age 18, no one is allowed tobe in the session without the childs consent.Second, ethical and legal standards generally require that acounselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, butnot both. This means that a counselorshould not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who shouldhave custody of a child.Third, knowing the details of any parenting plan orseparation agreement is important.Generally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child andcan be present during the childs sessions.If a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies thatone of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent canconsent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childssessions.In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seekingout legal advice specific to your state law."
"He is an adolescent. He has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years, all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video. We have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment, but after a few months of having then back, he pees his pants again.","Sounds as though your son is pissed off about something.Punishment will most likely result in more of the same, not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happening.Laziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own merit.Is this your description of your son or his description of himself?First step always before addressing any of the family dynamics, emotions, and psychology of the people involved, is a medical rule out as to why your son pees at times he plays video games.If he has medical clearance that there is no physiological problem, then talk with your son on his opinions as to why he pees, if he is aware of the urge to pee and ignores it, or that his attention gets so absorbed he doesnt notice the urge to pee.See what modifications you can create by cooperating with your son.Maybe it is as simple as each two hours, he sets a timer and when it goes off, he takes a bathroom break."
Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?,"It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn.A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group.Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer groupAsk a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own.I encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, Hey, I noticed something, or Let me help you be successful. By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help.When does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety.The vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity, then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company."
"Me and my adult daughter just do not get along. Shes very belittling to me when I dont agree with her. Its almost like she scolds me. We get into all out war. Shes said I dont support her in what she does and that Ive never loved her. She calls me horrible names, and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names.","As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound, theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feels.To some degree, your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the other.Developing ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel, would probably help a lot.One major point to be aware, is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic, because it is strong, may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adults.Watch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority, instead of considering her as a grown person.The same is true of your daughter. She may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she is.Her needs from you are real, they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way."
"We are the legal guardianship of our grandson. He has been acting out, and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year. How are we to handle this?","Hi Boone, This depends a lot on his age and the situation. The younger the child is, in general, the more I would see this as your decision, not his. A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters, but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution.Some questions... Was the parent harmful to the child? Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child? How likely is it to be a positive experience? Do you have any contact with the parent? You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen. I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind. What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent? Is it to see them and know the parent is okay, to get an apology, to apologize for a perceived hurt, to have regular contact, to find out if they are loved...? What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind. This will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill. Once you know the need, try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contact.Once you determine the risk of the childs need not being met, then you decide whether it makes sense. The older the child, the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves.There are other options than a facetoface. He can write to his mom or dad, text or email.Its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved, wanted, worth some effort. When a child is separated from a parent, they tend to blame themselves. Whether he sees the parent or not, he will need extra love, attention and support than a child who has two loving, present parents. I wish him the best and Im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson. Youre very special!"
"I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners. Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. I dont deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. Im not sure how to handle this.","Hi Arkansas,Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. Its a form of woman abuse and child abuse. Hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and hes not considering how its affecting the kids. Ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. Its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it.While you cant change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up. Hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy, but you dont have to fall for this. If you run around screaming hes lying!, it only makes you look more crazy. Try to stay calm, and dont put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, Id bet, but they dont know how to cope with that. If hes the only one fighting a war, youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Dont engage on his level.Dont blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their fathers agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isnt the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isnt their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you cant rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.Id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. Good luck!"
"We live with my expartners sister and her husband. We have been there for five years now. They are Hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language. Sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent. They neglect to see this. I do, and it reflects in my childs behavior. She sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isnt here, and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesnt know about his alcohol addictions.","Hi New York, Im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions. Although you dont say how old she is,and I imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth, I trust your instinct that now is not the time. Your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here, and I can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent. As much as this helps your daughter, I sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent. Children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence. These children need extra love and support wherever they can get it.You say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter. I understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times. It is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter, but its also natural for people to want to assist you. Lets trust that their intentions are good, if there is no evidence to the contrary. As much as they support you, they also have emotional ties to your daughters father.While there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation, there are also many positive factors here that I invite you to see.I dont know what your culture is, but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life. In general, the more adults around loving and supporting a child, the better.It could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family. Nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you. My hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has. They are potentially wonderful connections, and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm her.I suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family. If you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy, united supportive and loving safety net for her...thats the best outcome of all."
"My brother just broke up with his girlfriend. While they were dating for the past two years, her son spent the weekends with me and my mother. Now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us. How should we approach the situation? Is she doing the right thing for her child?","Hi Tampa, I get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him. Hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him. Certainly, it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship, it would be good for him to still have that contact. In my book, the more people loving a child, the better.But, ultimately, she has the right to make these decisions. To oppose her wont likely do any good. You can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well."
"My motherinlaw is mentally ill. She has been for most of her life. She cuts herself. She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself. She has had multiple shock therapy treatments, and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant. Her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late 30s. She doesnt even have custody of herself. She hasnt asked yet, but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child. How do I go about saying no without creating an issue?","Hi Fontana,Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. It seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response. I like your healthy boundaries, and Ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her.First, she hasnt asked yet, and you dont know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. Theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them, theyre more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if shes offended, that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if youre the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it wont happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying but maybe later. No need to apologize or hum and haw...We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in hisher life. try to leave out the but here. Youre not in a healthy place, and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your own.If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. Id let her know that its not negotiable, that you understand if shes disappointed, but youre not open to discussing the issue. Really, theres nothing to discuss. Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. I wish you the best."
"My daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years. She doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitation?Or is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughter?If no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up, no one has even asked where she is, why she isnt present, then I dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter, than the father is willing to make for seeing her.If your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist, then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or not.The one move Id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place, being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past, of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated."
"My fianc and I have been in a relationship for two years. We have an infant son. My fianc also has a child from a previous relationship. We do not live together. I live with my mother currently while I get on my feet, and hes living with some friends. My mother and I have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time. We cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house. She has made it clear that she wants me gone. Recently, I was talking to my father who lives in a different state. My father and I have always had a good relationship. I explained to him the situation I am in with my mother, and he said he would like for me, my fianc, and our son to come live with him and his wife. I would really love to go. I do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer. There is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state. The problem is my fianc is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child. He and his childs mother have a horrible relationship, and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away. I believe I would be doing what is best for my child by moving away, but I do not want to leave without my fianc. I have already explained the situation to him, and he will not give in. Do I continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together? Do I move away with my child and have my relationship end? I do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives. What do I do?","Hi Bethlehem,You have a big decision to make. I appreciate your fiancs need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad, and I am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe place.Im a bit confused, because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fianc would get your own place together.I get that you want your dad to take care of all of you, but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent. I say that without knowing how old you are, but if you have a child and a two year relationship, you basically have declared your independence anyway.I wish you the best."
"Just wondering if this is a deviant act, and if I should be concerned for him. He isnt quite 10.","Well its certainly unusual, and potentially could be cause for alarm. Its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally, so I would wonder if this child is trying to say something.I think without any context, however, or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance, its impossible to say whats going on. If there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours, you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly."
"My boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend. He goes to see her twice a week or more. Every time she leaves, he gets into these funks like when his mom died. When shes here, shes disrespectful, and his answer is Well, I dont know what to tell you. She swears and talks back, and he laughs. He and her mom have been apart for three years, and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young. We never have adult time when shes not here. Shes the golden child, and he wont listen to anyone.","Hi Lockport, Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky. You dont tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult, because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home.A bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent. Thats for your boyfriend to decide. When hes there, hes the parent, and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not. Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree, or you think you see something that hes not seeing, its simply not for you to interfere there.It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support. He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned. Do you talk about these things? Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do?Although I suggest you leave the parenting to him, what you can do is tell him what you see, offer suggestions if hes open to it, and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you. It makes sense to say I see you struggling and I dont know how to help, Ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her. Are you aware that its coming across this way? Do you need help?, or I feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone together.You sound a bit resentful of his daughter. Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his child?You have a voice, and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel. Ultimately, however, you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is, and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it."
"My exhusband told my two adolescents that Santa doesnt exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also dont want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cats out of the bag now, isnt it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love."
"For the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. Im at my wits end. How can I get them to stop and get along?","That is a good question. Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. Kids fight for different reasons wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them.These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. If this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict."
"My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training. He almost throws up every time he sees his poop. He gags and will not go on the toilet. We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet, but he refuses to use it. When he sits on the toilet, he just sits there forever and only will pee. He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress?","Your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained. You dont say how old he is, so Im not sure whether the problem is deeper, but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step. Pushing him at this point could worsen the problem, so I suggest pulling back the expectations, waiting a month or two, looking for more signs of readiness and trying again. In general, teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively."
"Im a senior high school student. Im also five months pregnant. I got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years. My parents dont want us to communicate with each other. He cant even come to visit my gynecologist. My mom goes to attend all of my doctors appointments. Shes supportive of me. I wish, though, that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram, at the very least. My family does not understand that he deserves that much. I cry all the time because I feel lost and hopeless. I need guidance and I believe that you can give it to me. Am I wrong for wanting him around? Are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents? I do everything that they ask of me. I just want him to be around. When I ask my parents to let him be here, they call me a selfish person. Please help me.","Youre not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your child.Do your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person? Or, do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life?Ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend. Ask them also to understand your point of view.Now is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is born.Your mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for you.Consider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit. Your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address these.Look online for womens resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this matter.Good luck with the remainder of your pregnancy, labor and delivery!"
"Tonight, my husband seemed to put our son down through an incorrect approach. His approach was perfectly wrong. I found myself defending my son. I told him that what he did was not the way to encourage our son. Instead of watching my husbands harsh behavior I decided to sit beside my son and, together, we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study. My husband got upset and he was swearing at me. He threatened me. I knew that he was not joking. His words scared me a lot!","I have had these many cases, but in situations like this.... If it does get out of hand, the police do need to be involved. Sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective."
"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didnt remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesnt remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now Im not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.","Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what youve lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation."
I regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me. But it feels like nothing I do seem to work. Ill always love them no matter what and when Im with them nothing else matters. I love them more then anything. I dont want another guy raising my kids.,"How you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far? Repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships. Your love sounds deep, sit with that. Also sit with how shes been hurt. You get to feel your hurt too and your kids. In feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair. If feeling all this is tough to take on, seek out a local therapist to support your process."
"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows its wrong we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses.Have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence, sexualphysical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.. It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced.I wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults care."
"All my friends have either hooked up or had a girlfriend but me. I try to be happy for them, but I get really upset every time they hook up.","If you mean hooked up as having sex with no care for the person, and youd like a girlfriend, then realize relationships require more complex alignment with a partner than being a sex buddy.Pay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that youll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allure.Also, the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someone.Have patience and kindness toward yourself while you get to know the qualities which attract you to a potential girlfriend."
"Im always told Im not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100 in to every thing. Im worn out, Ive worked on all of my family relationships, Im doing great in school, Im kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I dont have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow its still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?","Hello, and let me say first, what a great question!There are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from, I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.First, I think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough. Is that ACTUALLY what they said, or is this just what you heard? Sometimes, because of our own selfdoubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough. Explore with them how you feel your already giving your best.If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If youre in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If its a relationship that MUST continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation.Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100 good enough for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives.The question becomes, what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others, because its really YOU youre trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of whats left. After all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!I recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation.I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Eleanor Roosevelt."
My grandma had a stroke and passed away recently. I lost my home and job. Im looking but havent found a job. Ive been binge watching television and binge eating.,"Hello!I write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in selfesteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job.First of all, please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother. It appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life. The grief process of anger, denial, despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time. Perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief? Death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss, thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a longterm basis. I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. Grief and loss can also have an effect on your selfesteem. Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing?One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! Take time to give yourself some credit for the time you are spending looking for work. Also, I would recommend you set some shortterm goals first for example, make a list of 510 potential new employers and send them each your resume. Then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions. It is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door, so to speak.I hope that this information is helpful to you! Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Warmly,Denise"
I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?,"Youve already taken the first step. You want to not hate yourself. Selfacceptance is hard! And its on a spectrum. On one side we have selfhate, on the other extreme selflove. And then, there is all this stuff in the middle. It kind of looks like thisAnd working toward selflove often means moving around through all these. Becoming aware of your emotions, exploring the parts of you you that easier and harder to accept, selfkindness, selfforgiveness, selfcompassion and ultimately selflove. It is a recovery process and has to be an active thing each day. Meeting with a counselor can give you a partner in that process. Your counselor can also help you to recognize pieces that may be more difficult to see from your eyes as they have an outside view. And with selfacceptance, confidence comes naturally although you may need to practice behaviors that show assertiveness, confidence and boundaries that protect you. Wishing you the absolute best with this!"
"Ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I dont know how to process this. Its bothering both of us.",Congrats on having a happiness problem.Go slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feels.On a deep level youre releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindly.Time is needed of repeated occurrences of this newfound loving behavior toward you.Gradually you will trust more and more that your new living relationship life is your reality.
"Im a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. Shes great. Shes funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. Its mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesnt like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I cant fathom why a woman like her is with me, so Im always dreading when a better dude will come along. I dont think shes happy. Shes very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole If you love them, let them go, but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I cant break up with her. Im literally trapped.","Hi Fort Worth, I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship. Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cant change her, what you can do, is change yourself. We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings. That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher. I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust. Has that ever showed up anywhere before? It has more to do with you and less to do with her. Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself. That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know. You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like. Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself. The rest will take care of itself. Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process. You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror. I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RN, LPCMH"
"About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but Ive tried 3 times. Now can I try but dont stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them. How can I stop thinking about them and dont let it get in my head? My parents said I dont weight that much but, they do think I am fat but, they tell me I am not. I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist, but they think I am fine and I think they dont want to deal with it.","Hey! I am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions, to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself, and to get support! And it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life! Take a walk over to the counseling office at school, the school nurse or consider reaching out to your Pediatricians office. You dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself! And maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health! I am rooting for you! Be Wise!"
"I feel as though Im suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood. I convince myself Im not worthy of happiness, and Im always afraid Im doing something wrong. Its as if I create little scenarios in my mind, and I start to believe them.","This is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss. Oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving, the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults. Especially when we get close to someone, it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life. So....our body, nervous system, and emotions respond in the same way. They feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us. Sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves. Therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns, process the early experiences, and be able to be in the present with your current relationships. It is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood."
"For the past year, I have been feeling pressured to do well in school, and it put a ton of stress on me. I have been bullied for five years, and for some reason, it is now sinking in, and I cant stop it. For some other reason, I cant find a hobby I can see myself doing without thinking bad about myself.","You may have reached the natural end point of working very hard in school and putting up with bullies or not knowing how to step to the side of people who bully you.Both conditions you have been living under, pressure to perform well in school, and the tension of someone bullying you, are quite draining.Now is probably time to recuperate from your emotional ordeal.Hobbies may be a little too lighthearted and distracting from the more major task of grounding yourself in feeling secure and settled, especially after such arduous effort academically and socially.Let your natural self guide you.If right now you need to simply grow strong again, then allow this process to slowly develop.Eventually all on its own when the time is right, you will find a hobby.Now is your time to trust yourself to live the rhythms of your life."
"Im a teenage girl, and I feel very bad about my weight. I dont know how to make it stop.","One way may be to take some sort of physical movement class in which you will be regarded by the teacher as one of the students, not the girl who weighs a certain amount.In a movement class such as pilates, yoga, aerobics, weights, dance, when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing, and to be considered as one of the students, not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh, may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you!"
"What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We dont agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very familyoriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. Im not a familyoriented person. I only have two people in my life my best friend and my wife. My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. Weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I dont want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life. I dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy. Im dying to make our relationship healthy. Ive never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, youre right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. Thats not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well."
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"I also want to note that we, as a society, are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves. I am sorry that this boy said something insensitive. There is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything. It also wasnt his place to judge you.As women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others. Men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate. You didnt deserve his rudeness."
On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?,"I get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice.You dont say how old you are. Its likely that, if you are young, your body will change as you mature, but in general, were given the bodies were given and Im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is. You seem to want to stop disguising it. Bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like. Many men go through this as well, although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look.Young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them. In fact, other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you.I suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear, and if someone is rude enough to comment on it, you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint. But my bet is they wont even notice."
"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like they just want nothing to do with me.","It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer."

I hate everything I see in the mirror. I dont like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. Its stressing me out. I dont trust my parents enough to tell them and I dont know what to do.,"This is so very common in this crazy looksobsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who cant see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when were young and the best thing we can do is see the authors evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once youve addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you dont like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something thats lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You cant change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become, you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it wont change is a good idea, because wishing it were different wont make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a makeover. Play with your features and wardrobe. There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!"
"Whether its to a guy or girl, I always feel insecure talking, and I am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. Even when I am walking, I worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","Hi. Im glad you wrote, because I think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much. You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing. But your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and its true...that other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think Im weird? Were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself.My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from as well as genetics a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times. Without more details, its difficult to go further here. I recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy, which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully."
"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I dont seem anything other than happy, she asks me Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me, and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it, only she can. We cant change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her if thats true, but you dont have to pity her."
"I always feel the need to impress people, whether its my family, the people at school, or just random people. I know that no matter what I do or how I change, there will always be some people who hate me. Why do I feel this way?","My first reaction to this is that It sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world, that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside, build yourself up on the inside, work on yourself, use positive affirmations daily, it would be wise for you to research some selfconstruct theory and do some selfconcept work.Hope this helps,C"

"Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesnt usually do much to help us in the longrun. People may make changes for a shortterm period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesnt necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesnt happen again.Thatyouhave done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesntusuallyhelp the people who you hurt. In fact, someones guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100 about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many selfhelp books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

"I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down. Its ruining my mood and even my whole self. I have trouble sleeping, and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me.","The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spirit.Are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you?Have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint?Or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind, as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say?If actual conversations are leading you to feel left out, then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person.Or, you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out, are no longer worthwhile ones for you.If the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you, then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others."
I feel like Im trying to convince myself that Im okay when Im not. Im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.,"I can relate! When things are going badly, I feel like my life hasalways been and will always be that way. But I also do this when things aregoing well. That is, I forget how good things can turn bad. Personally, toavoid this emotional rollercoaster, I try and heed the famous advice by authorand feminist Rita Mae Brown One of the keys to happiness is a badmemory.So maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really astrength! It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me. And while its hardto manage my past and my future, the moment seems like a small enough piece oftemporal real estate to sort out.

Youve ask a very deep and insightful question, provingthat your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because Im anexample of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of convincingyourself that youre okay when youre not, how about calling it acceptingyourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness. Youprobably have high standards perfectionism? and thats a thing to talk with acounselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. Its called goodenough.Blocking out the bad things andforgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do itexcept when it comes to lifethreatening bad things so why shouldnt we? Thismight be called optimism.Feeling alone and uncared foris a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means I supposethat you dont despise yourself as much as you just dont care for you becausewe can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others. This is an abstractconcept that will take some time to get used to. But I have a suspicion that,with just a little more selfcare, and a little more caring for others, youmight be better off very soon."

What do you NEED in a relationship? What is holding you to this relationship other than your child? What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect? Just a few questions to ask yourself..
"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but Im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I cant seem to forgive myself. Im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.","Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions.My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound.If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened, that you cant erase it, and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore.You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! Youve come clean, youve been honest, youve taken responsibility for your actions, youve not tried to minimize what you did, and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably. Its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now. Its not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...its how we handle them afterwards.I wish you growth and happiness."
"When Im not cutting, Im drinking. When I try healthy outlets such as exercise, I end up running myself down into an asthma attack. From weapons, to words, I cant help but self harm. What am I supposed to do, how do I stop this cycle? I dont know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain.","It sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control, you are concerned about your behavior, and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it. In working with a therapist, you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors, develop strategies for taking care of yourself, and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self."
"Im in my late 20s, and Ive never had a boyfriend or even been on a date. I have no friends. I hate Facebook because everyone else has kids and a great husband and great paying jobs. I work in retail, and I cant find a job. I have an Associate degree. No one is not giving me a chance, and Im getting upset and frustrated. I feel worthless and feel like everyone hates me. I feel like a failure, and I still live with my Dad. Its very embarrassing!","In case knowing this helps you, there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realize.Similar to you, they are not on FB for the reasons you list. Plus, no one wants to go on FB and tell the world they dont have a fantastic life. Everyone on FB is happy, even when theyre miserable theyre happy telling everyone about it.First, yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living. Please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have, is not necessarily the true life they are having. Ive been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30, start having problems by their midthirties.Second, respect your unique identity. For whatever reason, you have more sensitivity, possibly more depth, more complex standards and expectations, of yourself and others.As hard as it may sound or actually be, take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you, you need for your own growth and development.Feeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive. Consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goals.I hope this helps!"
"Its been almost a year since my exboyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadnt told him I knew because I didnt want us to break up. I used to have very low selfesteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My exboyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still cant get over this betrayal. Im not sure what to feel to get over it forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me 3000, so Im grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although were not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and thats it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my exboyfriends Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.","The dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationship.Continue developing some points youve written here.That you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her, very likely set a standard in your inner self, to expect similar circumstances in your relationship life.This is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us. What we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal, no matter how bad it actually is.After all, children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do, is wrong compared with the rest of our culture.It is natural to long for a relationship.What you have the chance to do now, is distinguish the reasons for your longing.Is it to attach to someone who has hurt you, hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you, and whose validation, even if he says validating words, has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm us?If youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us, and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you, then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime."
"Im in my early 20s. Ive been married once, and he cheated on me. Ever since then, Ive felt ugly no matter what. Im engaged, and I still feel ugly. I dont like to take pictures of myself.","Sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband.He did an ugly action, and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on, you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it.Does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident?You may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt. It is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until now.As you address all the emotional pain youve lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own. Because youd be focused on you, not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband."
"Im scared that I am with this man so I wont be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I dont want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think. Since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him, I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together. I suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other. The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place. Dont try to figure out whether you should be with him. Just talk. The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you dont deserve him is rooted in a core lie that you are telling yourself. You can read about core lies and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human. Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself. You are deserving!Mark"
"I like getting attention from men. I dont have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to. I like to tease, I like for men to chase me, and I like to feel wanted.","Hi Michigan, Good for you for recognising a destructive pattern. This behaviour, although it might get you the attention you want initially, will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them. My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone. Thats a powerful thought. You are certainly acting as if this is true. If you believed in your value as a person, you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general.If I were your therapist, Id have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from. Id suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour. Good luck!"
"Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so Im not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I cant seem to do anything right! No one else at school seems to feel the way I do! Is this normal teenage girls feelings? I dont think these feelings are normal.","There are some struggles that are less obvious than others, an eating disorder being one of them. From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low selfesteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are normal. It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes its best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out! Hope this helps!"
"I was raped by multiple men, and now I cant stand the sight of myself. I wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife.","Hello Utah, thank you for writing with your question. Sexual assault or sexual abuse is a very traumatic event that affects victims in many ways. Your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and selfloathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced. A good therapist can help you to process your traumas and understand that you did nothing wrong to cause the rapes the shame is not yours. It takes a very patient and loving partner, but you can make progress towards a healthier sexual relationship with your wife. These are issues that I cannot address more fully here other than to recommend that you seek the assistance of a qualified professional."
"I found messages between my boyfriend and this girl on social media. He was asking her for naked pictures and then hung out with her once, but nothing happened. I didnt find out about the messages until last month and that was six months after it happened. I cant trust him anymore and Im just wondering if I ever will. He admitted that he wanted to have sex with her but he didnt. He was only talking with her because he thought we were going to have a break up. My heart is completely broken. I feel like Im in competition with every girl on the planet for my boyfriends affection. Im afraid that he doesnt like me anymore, but without me hes homeless and without a car. I love him so much. Its been tearing me apart. I dont feel pretty anymore though. I dont feel good enough for anyone or anything. I thought I knew him as well as I knew myself. Then all of a sudden my world was flipped upside down. Im still trying to figure out which way is up.","Im sorry for so much stress in your relationship life.In what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you, to you?From what you write, you feel more aggravation, stress, loneliness and insecurity, than satisfaction by being in this relationship.Does he care that you dont trust him?Very often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are. The feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent.My suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner, may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship, your boyfriend actually has.These realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand, especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didnt adequately nurture you as a child.A therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest."
Im going through a majorly bad divorce and my wife is making things so impossible for me. I need help.,"Crying due to a dissolution of a marriage, is normal. Hating yourself may be a sign of extreme sadness, feelings of loss and uncertainty.Do you know why you hate yourself?Discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible, to move from hate to selflove.Divorce signals a loss of familiar life structure and daily routines. As with any meaningful loss, crying is part of mourning what is soon to be gone.If you have confidence in your attorneys handling of the legal areas related to the divorce, and the impossible you reference is on facing and coming to terms with statements and behaviors from your wife that you never noticed before, then your best choice is to find a therapist whom you feel at ease in talking with, to sort through the emotional upheaval within yourself and your everyday life and world.Divorce is a wonderful time for learning about ones own emotional needs and expectations in relationships since these are the areas currently coming apart.The good news behind losing something that seems valuable, is that new space becomes open to attract what is more suitable for who you are."
"About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I dont miss her as much as I used to but I just dont trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. Im so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, Ive just shut down. I havent felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. Im scared to because I dont want it to be taken away from me again. I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day. I just dont know what to do. Im working at a place I know I should enjoy. Im keeping up with my creative passions working out, eating healthy, etc. Im doing everything the books say I should do, but I dont feel any different. I just dont know what to do.","since you realize your sense of trust was broken, withdrawing from close relationships, makes sense.This may be your Self giving you natural time to recuperate from emotional pain.Also it is your chance to think over how to handle yourself differently in future relationships.Maybe this process requires more time than youd like.Having patience is very difficult when a person feels hurt.A therapist of your own may be a good idea so you have someone for guidance and to chart your progress w you.This may feel less lonely and help you tolerate the waiting period till youre better"
I feel like I have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? It started after I got raped by my exboyfriend.,"I recommend that you seek professional services to address the trauma you experienced. EMDR has been proven to be very effective in treating trauma. In addition, a support group might be helpful to find a more stable support network. Either a support group for victims of rape or sexlove addiction www.sa.org sound appropriate. Whichever group resonates the most with you will be the most helpful.If you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to ask."
"I keep hearing I am attractive from people around me, and I think I believe it. But I have low confidence regarding approaching girls I like.","I recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach a girl. When you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs, you can then work on changing them. An easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words must or never. Once you recognize the thought or belief, I would like you to picture a big red stop sign. This is called thought stopping. This is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts. Then, I would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as Negative thought That girl will never go out with me STOP Positive thought I wont know if she will go out with me unless I ask. What this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem."
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I cant stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldnt matter. I feel helpless and I dont know what to do.","Hey! It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone! And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings. A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend! Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness. Try this Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself. Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list. Then carry it with you in your wallet and when you need a selfesteem boost, take a look at it!

Reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer. Be Wise!"
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"Hi!Im sorry youre having this dilemma.I wish I knew a little more about the situation to give a better answer. Have you discussed what is causing you to consider breaking up with your partner? Based on the information given,I suggest starting off making a pros and cons list. Pros for staying in the relationship and cons for staying. See which side has more. Follow your gut. Hope this helps as a start."
"My husband and I are separated and he doesnt even want to talk to me. He says he doesnt love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back. Is there any hope?","There is always hope. So dont give up on hope.However, you knew I would say that, there is a lot work ahead of you.You need to see someone to talk things out.Get some space between you and your husband. Dont chase and please dont stalk him.Do some deep searching as to why he left and what part you had to cause the split.You cant change him but you are in control of your own change.With the help of a professional counselor you can get help and direction where you need to change."
"A year ago, the love of my life left me and never looked back. Our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart. I miss her so much and cant seem to get over being so heartbroken.","Who takes care of your son, is a significant part of getting over your heartbreak.If you made reasonable custody terms re your son then the relationship heartache is much easier to recover from than if your sons mother vanished from his life, or if the mother wants nothing to do w him.Re the actual relationship, let yourself feel sad and hurt since this is the truth.Usually life gradually fills in new people, including a relationship once you feel strong enough from having endured such sadness and loss."
"I got married in 2014. I have a two year old son. His mom and I decided to separate due to my infidelities. Weve tried to reconcile our differences but it never works out. Since weve been separated, Ive dated someone, and we are expecting a baby girl. Is this something I should mention to my wife? The current woman whom Im dating has been telling me for months to break up with her, but its hard because I actually love her.","My answer is yes, you should tell her because you have a child with her. She is the mother of your son, and this new baby would be his half sister. I think telling her is mature and appropriate. Usually procrastinating just makes it worse.Another thing to consider. Would you want her to tell you if she was pregnant with her boyfriends baby? Hope this helps, take care!"
"Our relationship ended about 7 years ago, but dont know how to let go. How can I get over that person and move on?","I think giving yourself the space to realize that this was a significant relationship and it really had an impact on you. I think you should honor that relationship and then talk about it to someone.The more you try to not think of it, the more you will think of it. I think you should instead, say thank you to that relationship. Thank you for showing you what qualities you like, what you desire. Maybe even come up with a list of what that specific relationship did for you. After you say thank you to that relationship then it may be time to say goodbye.You obviously want to get over that person, so figure out why you want to get over them. Why did it not work out? What negative parts of the relationship do you keep forgetting to think about. Oftentimes, people glamorize the past. So for your goodbye part of this phase, I would focus on the negative parts of the relationship. You can also work on emotionally saying goodbye to that time in your life. You are probably different than you were 7 years ago, and to be honest, they are probably different too.I know it sounds weird. But I would recommend that you mentally say thank you and goodbye to that relationship."
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but ts so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings Ive never felt before. I feel like I dont want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I cant discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered wrong by a lot of people. How can I get myself to just move on?","Well, there is some good news and notsogood news. The good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships, even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had, or deserved, before. Sometimes, even just the fact that this has happened for them can, eventually see below lead them to seek out love again, because they now believe they will be able to have that again.So, the notsogood news though is that one can not just move on. Id even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are. Instead, try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone even though someone didnt die, there is still a significant loss you are experiencing and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve, to feel whatever feelings of anger, or sadness, or something else that you are feeling. Often, it is really helpful to speak those feelings I recommend professionals in this case who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle, and instead that it is completely normal. Love is a crazy thing, and the feelings can get very confusing. But, the last stage of grieving is acceptance, and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial, anger, bargaining, and depression."
"I got engaged, and everything was going well. Things went downhill at some point, and I broke off the engagement due to an opportunity to go to college. After that, I found out she had been cheating on me. I think about her all the time now, and we have been communicating on and off, but my friendsfamily dont know.","Somehow you knew the marriage wouldnt have a good start if your fianc was cheating on you.Congrats on your intuition and following your intuition.An engagement breakup is full of disappointment and sometimes talking about the particular points help the couple to clarify and possibly set the relationship on new terms or feel more confident in the breakup.I suggest you identify what topics re the relationship youd like to clear up with your ex.If both of you are having touch and go conversation which doesnt address the deeper and more troubled areas which led to the cheating and breakup, there is a chance you both will go down a similar road of casual and light conversation which hits the wall of the deeper obstacles between both of you.Your friends and family dont need to know anything until you feel ready to tell them what you decide to tell them."
"He was in love with someone years ago, and he still thinks about her time to time. He said, and I quote, That relationship is definitely over. I love you, but that girl will always be in my mind. It just didnt feel like he appreciated all the things Ive done to make him happy.","Trust your intuition on your conclusion about this guy.He may very well love you, only with the ex so prominent in his mind, it is possible your feeling of not being appreciated now, would multiply if ever the two of you needed to address a delicate topic.Since he is emotionally attached to the former gf, it is very likely he wouldnt be able to fully love you as much as youd like and are already sensing."
"My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I dont understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors? I might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist.","What a burden for you!Your husband cannot seem to make up his mind on his viewpoint and doesnt seem to care whether or not youre affected by speaking out of two sides of his mouth.Keep yourself protected emotionally from him. Theres no good which can come by arguing with a person who flips their position.Live as separately as possible from him and stick to roommate type matters such as groceries, bill paying and housecleaning as discussion topics.If he cannot make sense of what he thinks and feels, then certainly you will face similar difficulty trying to do so!"
My husband and I are separated. He says he needs some time apart. He says he needs to get back the in love part of a relationship but doesnt want to lose me. Should I wait or start over new?,"Its not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time. It is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent. If you and your husband have been together for quite some time its likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other. While this is a good thing in some ways, it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that in love feeling he is referring to. Couples simply become ambivalent. For some of the couples I work with in my practice, I find that helping to organize a time apart, which I call a Therapeutic Separation can do wonders for the relationship. I offer homework to be done during this time. Reading, worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship. It often times brings more appreciation for their partners. When the pair comes back together, we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before."
I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change.

"After my fianc cheated on me because of a miscommunication, I pulled myself away from him. Now he says all he wants is be with me. Im pushing him away mentally now because he cheated on me again. I make plans with him that I dont keep. I really do love him still and I care about him. Should I give home one more chance?","People dont cheat bc of miscommunication. People cheat bc they feel diminished regard for their partner.You pulling away doesnt explain his behavior.If the two of you still were a couple at the time he cheated on you, then there were many alternatives he cold have taken besides disrespecting you.Try to understand whether you are satisfied and happy in the relationship. Your actions sound as though you are not either of these.Whether or not you decide to be together again many depend too on if the trust you had in him is restored. Do you feel you can trust him again?If the two of discuss your relationship then if you dont trust him right now and the both of you talk about your dynamics, then tell him about your feelings.Trust is foundational to feeling safe and happy in a relationship."
Im obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Moving on is the right question. Everyones different in moving on.

"I recently went through a divorce. My exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me. My sister never defended me. Now that I showed the truth, shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight. Why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning?","Sorry for so much emotional pain from the combination of the divorce and your sister not supporting you in the way you wish.When you feel ready and if you feel this would help, then consider to talk to your sister from perspective to improve the relationship the two of you have.Since the ex is gone and the sister is an ongoing person in your life, this particular incident is only one in many which the two of you will have with each other.The disappointment you feel now as to how she handled herself, is a point to bring up to her for the sake of clarifying the type of relationship you each would like to build with each other.As to your specific question as to why she did what she did, she is the only person who has the answer.Start with finding out if she wants to improve the relationship altogether. Then you can use her lack of support with the ex, as an example of how meaningful her support of you is to you."
"She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.","Given the short amount of time you know this girlfriend, there is no history on which to make a judgment about the likelihood of what she will do next.Certainly she is confusing by telling you she likes you and is with someone new. And not giving you any explanation as to why she made her decision.Id suggest two possibilities.Speak with her and ask her if she considers opening your relationship with her.Or, simply wait and see what she does when you contact her in a friendly way.Pay attention to your own satisfaction level.If you get more answers from her which arent agreeable with you, then it is time to put the hope for this relationship behind you.Then youll have clear space to find someone who is as interested in you as you are in them!"
"My exgirlfriend says shes bored and wants to experience life single. I treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didnt do anything, I feel remorseful, and Im willing to do whatever it takes to get her back. Shes unhappy. When I called her, she was crying and said she will text me when shes ready.","Were you happy with the ways she satisfied you?A relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the other.Strange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored, rather than say they feel hurt.Is it possible you are being selfcritical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend?Either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treated.Since shes putting up a barrier to communicating with you, better for you to respect this than contact her by phone again.Consider in a few weeks, so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person, to write her an email which states your interest to reopen the relationship.Who knows, you may even decide by the end of a few weeks, that youre fine without this particular relationship.Depending on her response to your email, youll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue."
My fianc and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didnt actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldnt have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him. In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fianc didnt seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you."
"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her. She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partners actions.If youd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didnt continue as you wished."
"He had a sexual relationship with his sister and kept it from me for years, I confronted about it and he finally told me what happened. But I dont think he is telling me the whole story. He works with her and sees her every day. I feel that I shouldnt stay with him , but he says he ended it long time ago. Should I trust my husband and stay with him?","Trust is a necessary factor for an intimate relationship to feel safe.The person who must repair the trust is the one who has broken this trust.The best way to find out if your husband wants to restore your trust in him, is to ask him this question. He may not be willing to meet your request.If he hesitates or becomes defensive about the need to restore your trust, then ask him to think his decision through and tell him the serious consequence you are considering.Ask him to reflect for a few days or a week and then to address the topic again.If you and he consistently find that he is unwilling to do anything at all to regain your trust, then I agree you have serious thinking to do as to whether or not youd be able to live within a partnership based upon trust, in which you dont trust your partner."
"My exfianc whom I am still seeing left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom his exgirlfriend of 20 years. He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his exgirlfriend and kids. He is coexisting for the kids and fighting all the time with his exgirlfriend. His daughters dont want their dad with me because my two boys grown adults and on their own now had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to do the right thing and stay with his exgirlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a 1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him theyd never speak to him again if he married me. He says hes trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your selfesteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here."
"Ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years. Even though I care about him, he continues to hurt me. He and his wife were separated when we met. Now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard. I want to end this relationship, but I dont feel like I can. How can I let go?","Hello, and thank you for your question. Boy, ending relationshipsis tough, isnt it? Sometimes its tough even when we are 100 sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts, and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing. In other words, its not really something you can reach out and grab. Its more of a process. This is good news, because you dont necessarily have to be atthe end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what wouldhave been their anniversary. This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end, and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. Its hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single! Sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. Its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. Its fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. Its okay to be afraid. Its okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that,someonecan still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on, and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce. SometimesNOT makingdecisions stresses us out A LOT more than making a decision and living with the consequences, both good and bad. You may be at that crossroads. Be well..Robin J.

"I was in a relationship for almost five years. We were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship. He was a caring, friendly, and charming guy up until three and a half years in. He started controlling me who I hung out with, where I was at all times, and he had a huge hissy fit if I tried to ask him the same questions. All that time, he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my socalled friends. At the end, he was a nasty and narcissistic person. Now its hard to be social.","It sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship, and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people. It is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships, we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with others.Therapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships, to unpack what happened in prior relationships, and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want. Often, relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them, enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship."
"Were not together, but Im still doing things for him and we are intimate. Hes not there for his son.","You didnt ask a direct question because I feel from what you wrote you already know the answer. I hate to sound harsh but I am a therapist that call it how I see it so brace yourself...You will always continue to have problems with letting your childs father go as long as youDont love or respect yourself first...Dont love and respect your son...Dont demand respect as a woman and mother...Give up the goods regardless of what he does for you or your son...Dont hold your son as a priority in your life....Have self worth of a 1, etc.I have a feeling you are saying...I do love my son and hold him as a priority even if you dont do it for yourself...I would ask...Are your actions of allowing such disrespect from his father proof of that?I know what I have said may have gotten under your skin...I want it to.... because I feel that you have a conscience, want to do better, know you and your son deserve better and you can do better. Believe in yourself and that you and your son DO desire better and it starts with you setting boundaries with his father. You can do it!!!"
"My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me. Hes been talking about divorce, but he hasnt filed. Now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids. He has no financial help, and he has been out of the home for four months. He became very angry and mean. He says its all my fault, and that were not compatible.",Its hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage.. could be... but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more.
"My husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and I moved out. He is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. Im not sure if I trust that he will not go back to his old ways.","I am glad he is seeing a counselor. That is something that most men struggle with doing at times. Time will tell if his actions are of good intentions. However remember that a person can only doto youwhat youallowthem to do in relationships. What part did you play? Did youdown play hisdisrespect at one time?Did you give up the power of your own voice? Did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided? Did you allow him to make you doubt yourself? In others words, if you do decide to give him another chance,what would you do different? Not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative wordsAT ALL, but dont allow such disrespect from him oranyone else in the future. If you do decide to give it another try, go in witha voice, with the demand of respect, with your needs and wants expressed and expected.With an increase in your self worth and confidence, youwill knowwhat to doifhis actions are trueorifwith dishonest intentions.Seek counseling as well, if you need that additional support to find self."
"My exboyfriend boyfriend and I lived together. He had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. One was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. They are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. He has nothing to offer me.","Hi Attica,This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them.In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people, honestly, its a game... to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you. If you dont want contact from this person, its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries Dont contact me again, and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you dont want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me. Thats great selftalk.But lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes its because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days. The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of. People do change and grow, but it wont happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.Another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. Its as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance."
"My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?","In any relationship, including marriage, each partner will be better able to do their part, by understanding their own interests and wishes.Concentrate more on what youd like from your marriage. This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasnt taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if youd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to redirect your speculations about, what does he want, I wonder what hes thinking, back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!"
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and weve been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship. There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work.Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other.That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband. It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt youre willing to tolerate and the reason youre willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesnt start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so."
I keep on begging him to come back. I am so unhappy with him but am so scared of being a single parent to our son. I was abused as a little girl and that has made to be very abusive to men. What should I do...,"Major change frightens almost everybody.Dont be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriage.If you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now, new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mind.Consider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your Self.A therapy relationship, since it is safe and supportive, will be a good balance to having been abused, suffered, and unhappy."
My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and its all sudden. I understand that marriages have their ups and downs but I dont understand why she cant tell me why she wants a divorce. Should I fight for my family daughter and wife?,"Chances are, if you really think about it, there were signs that something wasnt quite right in your marriage. You may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage, but whatever it was or wasnt, its obviously bothering your wife. I would say yes, keep trying to fight for your family, at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable. Ask your wife if shes willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor. Just be sure youre open to hearing whats said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some things.Even if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce, that doesnt mean youre divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that. Continue to be a part of her life. And although it may be difficult, if a divorce does happen, try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isnt further impacted by this new family dynamic."
"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. Im coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesnt care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I dont exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.","I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didnt have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low selfesteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they cant do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be.Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people dont want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement I dont feel like I exist anymore tells me that in addition to low selfesteem, you also dont have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self.Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google positive affirmations to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be I am a good person who deserves to be happy or I can do this. Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at a time."
"I am conflicted with this guy I work with. He is a coworker and close friend whom Ive had a crush on since meeting him four years ago. We made out once after years of flirting. I was hoping for more, but nothing happened. I distanced myself a lot after.","Hello! Emotions run high in crush situations and when emotions run high its not uncommon for us to have emotionbased instead of factbased thoughts. After reading your question, I wondered how you went from making out to nothing happened? I wondered if this happened because of an emotionbased thought that sounded like If he liked me, he would make something happen. A truer and more empowering thought might be I want something different to happen with him and I want to take a different action to see if that can happen. This thought focuses more on the one thing you can control YOU. Hopefully, the thought also empowers you to think through what you can do to gauge interesttalk with him about his feelings on the matter. I hope this helps and good luck to you!"
I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His coworker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"The offspring are your PropertyIf you require that no other man show inappropriate content to them, then require compensation for use and enjoyment of your Property, without your consentSend them a billWhen they do not pay it, activate the local Sheriff, take them to small claims court, and win a judgment against them for failure to compensate for the use and enjoyment of your PropertyI wonder what might happen after that... learn to act as man ... and watch the magic happen..."
"My boss took over some work Id begun. Concerned that she had doubts about my work, i asked her for feedback. I assured her that I did my utmost for customer service, and asked if I was deficient. She then said this was me being codependent.","This interaction with your boss seems strange. It is tricky to know how to handle workplace conflicts, but there are typically resources in place to help employees and mangers communicate successful and feel confident that they are being treated fairly at work. Is there an HR department that you can use as a mediator?"
"I am in a high stress position for a tech company. I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing. What can I do to manage my stress?","I think its important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress. It is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid. You will not perform well as you mention, and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort. So, I dont know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first step.You dont speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like, which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything, including people at our job. I would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss. Often, overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me, and that can demoralizing. If we feel appreciated, that can go a long way. Ive found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation and it goes deeper than thank you or taking you out to lunch its almost something felt as opposed to made explicit.But sometimes appreciation isnt going to do the trick either. Because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout. You have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed, so some real changes need to be implemented.The bottom line? Try not to just suck it up and do all of the self care work on your own. If your company isnt helping you to take care of yourself Im talking to you, boss that handles employee pay andor work conditions! then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for. While I dont know exactly what you do, it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions! So take that confidence to a tech company that will support you and there are tech companies out there!"
"Ive been suppressing it for quite some time, but there are days when I cant make eye contact with her. I think she knows, and we both admitted there was some type of vibe, but the overall discussion was vague. I think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us. Its driving me crazy. As an act of expression, I have purchased a gift for her thats personalized. I havent given it to her yet.",There are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace. Sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace.
"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that Im doing things she finds disrespectful even when I dont mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart. I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesnt, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?","Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity. Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, I feel you distancing from me. In other words, its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart. The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind, my dear, or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie. The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much. Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, Im sorry. However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry, I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at 514 6902469."
"I was having a sexual relationship with a coworker. He decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend. Before I got paid, I told him I would have 25.00, which I thought I would. But when I saw my paycheck, I could not pay the 25.00. He says I lied to him about it. He wants me to reimburse him 25.00 for the hotel room he decided to get. He stayed at the hotel, and I left. I dont think its right that he want me to reimburse him 25.00 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place. He is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me I am a liar and that I should never said I was going to have 25.00 when I knew I wasnt. I told him I had to pay rent and my rent was late. He texted me saying I need to get two or three jobs.","Hello, and thank you for your question. It really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 25.00. If you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him, then pay when you can. I am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over 25.00. I know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much, but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts. You may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC"
"Im a teenager, and I just got my first job. I am a month and a half in. Yesterday, my boss pushed me to the point where I had to go to the restroom and cry. She didnt see me, and Im glad, but when I went to talk to her about it today, I let a tear or two come out. I hate it. I feel like theyre not going to keep me anymore.","Getting your first job is an exciting, terrifying, and challenging experience. It is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker. You are literally learning as you go in this completely new environment. You are going to make mistakes. You are not going to get it right the first time. It can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. A couple of things to remember here 1 You are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it, 2 There is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work, 3 you know best what you need in order to be successful. These three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. If you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. Also let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand. Becoming a successful worker doesnt happen overnight, but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesnt by communicating with your work team, the easier it will be for you. We all had a first job once, and were all worried about doing well. Hang in there, and call a counselor if you need more help."
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you dont admit to. Employers can suggest or something stipulate in continued employment with them for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider EAP if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships. No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile. Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist."
"Ive worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didnt, and three months later, Im still not over it. Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants. Were no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and hes constantly touching me, so Im still very drawn to him. Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but hes clearly not interested. Hes younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","It sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations which is understandable. On the one hand you want to get over him, on the other you are still holding out hope for something more. It will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more. If you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him. If you are wholeheartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start. It is hard to just be friends when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins."
Does this go against any ethical codes? Are there legal ramifications?,"Generally, the ethical codes only prohibit relationships with clients.There are however a few types of counselortocounselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes. Such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees between professors and students or any time the relationship might negatively impact your or their clients.Lastly, some workplaces have rules against dating coworkers. It would be a good idea to check if there is such a rule that applies to you."
I dont know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"What exactly is it that you are looking for? Different people define themselves in different ways. For example, one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics. Still, another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies. Learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience. At the same time, who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them. Try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing. Allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to theexperiences you have. This may help youto know more about what you value, what you like and dislike, and what you want for yourself in life.Best of luck to you!"
"I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy. Because of my religion I cant tell my family. I know they wont accept me. What do I do?","I understand that this must be a difficult time for you withmany adjustments. If you feel comfortable enough to ask your parents to see aLife Coach or a therapist, this may be an excellent place to start. You dontneed to tell them the reason why maybe say that you simply need someone to talkto for support with school or homework etc. The Life Coach or therapist wouldbe the optimal person to advise you on how to proceed with providing supportand guidance. There may be someone at your school whom you could talk to forconfidential support and guidance as well. Be confident in the fact that youare not alone and there are always responsible adults available to guide youthrough any difficult process you may experience in life. Talking to familyabout personal issues can be difficult for anyone, even adults. I recommendgetting help from a trusted, professional adult before you decide what to do."
"My fianc and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that Im not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","For you and your fiance to move past this, he needs to accept you just the way you are. Being that you mentioned that you both come from a Christian background, maybe you could start there, he needs to forgive and trust your love for him. His insecurities stem from something bigger than you not being a virgin. Since this is the man, you are willing to spend the rest of your life with, be patient and help him find the help he needs. Talk about your commitment to him and reassure him that your history does not have to affect your relationship. Lastly, PreMarital Counseling can help you and him to open up about other things that might affect the marriage later.God Bless You Both, Mirella"
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes dont know whats real or not. If feel at times like everyones lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","There are an infinite number of ways to look at this. Spirituality, religion, God, higher power, and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people. My question for you is what does real actually mean to you? Often, the concept of God has to do with what you believe in. If you ask 1000 different people, youll probably get almost that many different answers.Consider talking with friends or family about this. I would suggest, though, that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do. You may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure. The local Salvation Army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services. There may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussion.Just a word of caution. In my experience, ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe. Some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others. When initiating conversations about this, try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality. A second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions.As far as whether God is real or not, consider trusting yourself and what you learn, feel, and believe as you work through this process."
"Im a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasnt clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isnt the one God planned for me? Were so young, but that doesnt stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. Im incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much.","Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or Gods will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priestpastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation. Group dates, public places and no alone time where temptations might arise.Forgive yourself and move on."
"Im a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I dont know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldnt like it. My parents are very religioustheyre Christians. We did things every time hed come over to my house. We didnt have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when wed watch movies by ourselves. One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and hes not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. Theyre always yelling at me about how I shouldnt date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now Im kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I dont talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think Im deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if Im still with him, I cant do track and they wont support me. Theyve also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. Im actually very happy with him. They also say Im living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do isif you havent already, have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and lettingthem know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from therelationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not followtheir rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper.Not everyone will always approve of the choiceswe make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you."
"In particular during family gatherings such as funerals, where there are different customs.","I think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes. Although everyone may not agree with one another, the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction.There are many families that are united despite their differences. For example, a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish. By introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial.Also, its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences. So dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues.Creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential."
There are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. Ive been torn for so many years and I need help so I can move on with my life. I experienced trauma when I was 8 years old and I did come out about it until I was 40. Now I know this is whats holding me back on my happiness. Ive met a very loving and caring man but because Im holding on to these things from my past Im pushing him away. How can I get my life back?,"You already are doing that! You are reaching out virtually still counts!. You are accepting your past, you are not denying what happened to you, you are talking about the past. You are already doing a great job of starting this journey. You get your life back by doing things differently.I would think about how you would like to process your past. Do you want to talk to someone? Do you want to write about it? Do you want to pray about it? Do you want to read and research books about trauma? Take some time and think about what you want to do. Think about what would work for you and dive in. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, so I am biased but I really believe that counseling works. Having an objective, professional voice that can guide you on this process is so valuable. But please choose what makes you feel comfortable not what everyone else says. I think you are very brave for reaching out and wanting to work on this. That takes a tremendous amount of courage and strength."
"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. Its almost as if Im a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","Hi!This is a great question!The term you are looking for is alexithymia, the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. However, just because you are not able to feel or express emotions, does not mean that you do not have emotions.After such a traumatic event that you experienced, your central nervous system goes into defensive mode dorsal vagal nerves that protect you from any further harm. What this means is if you were to feel your emotions related to your rape, you would have a sense of being overwhelmed, possibly reexperiencing the traumatic event.Not feeling emotions is your bodys way of protecting you from any further trauma. Unfortunately, when the parasympathetic dorsal vagal system shutting down feeling is activated and suppresses your painful emotions pain, shame, guilt, sadness, anger, it also shuts down your positive and relational emotions love, joy, contentment, connectedness, happiness.I am very sorry that you had to go through such a traumatic experience as being raped. No one knows what is going on inside of you as a result. You dont know what is happening to your emotional wellbeing! The best and at times, difficult and scary thing is to process your emotions related to your trauma. This processing is done carefully, with a trained counselor, in a place that you feel safe, heard, and not judged. Although the thought of proceedings addressing emotions may be anxietyinducing, it brings on a huge sense of relief and validation.What you are going through is normal, considering what happened to you! I hope you reach out for more help.If you have any questions feel free to contact me, Catherine atclevelandemotionalhealth.com"
"I have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?","You are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative. It is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in PTSD symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiences.If you have been deployed to a combat area, you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the VA Vet Centers. The Vet Center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma. Heres a link to a directory of Vet Centers service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated."
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago. How can I get my life back?","This is a great question. PTSD can be very complex and debilitating. It must be very difficult for you at this time.When we feel complex emotions such as anger, frustration, and possibly lowself worth, the tendency is to try to avoid or suppressthese emotions. The more you avoid them, the more these emotions will express themselves, and at the worst times. This may be why your PTSD symptoms are harming your relationships and your job status.To help you get your life back, it is important to process your emotions with a counselor that has specific training in traumainformed interventions. To process emotions, you start by inviting them in, observe them with compassion and without judgment. When we observe our emotions, it starts the healing process because we separateourselves from them.Remember, thoughts and emotions are constructed. You are not your thoughts, nor your emotions. They are messengers telling you to pay attention to them. The more we avoid the messengers, the louder they get, to the point that they are crippling you in more than one way.I hope this helps you begin your change process.

And contact mewith any questions.Sincerely Catherine ClevelandCleveland Emotional Health"
I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuserape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. Im trying to learn to cope with them.,"Have you tried counseling? Having PTSD from multiple abusive sexual experiences is very overwhelming for one to handle alone. You may need the guidance, experience and support of a professional to identify all the triggers that effect you and obtain the best coping skills that would work for you."
"My girlfriend was abused as a child. Now, if I hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child. What might be going on?","Was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenly?Also, are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other, enjoying each other?Its possible her physical withdrawal, due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch, reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward you.This can be either strong positive or negative feelings.She may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you, and withdraws.She may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from others.Best way forward as almost always in a relationship, is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you."
I recently lost a friend to suicide. Im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is not a natural way to pass from this Earth, so many times it can be EXTREMELY tough to deal with because of the unnaturalness of the event. We may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it, but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him. You are currently trying to numb your feelings, those feelings as nasty as they are, are meant to be felt, those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation. Your friend has a legacy, remember it, and honor that legacy everyday in some small or even grand way, perhaps committing or volunteering your time to help others in honor of your friend.Hope this helps, C"
"I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.","Sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painful.Everyone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions, handed down to them simply by living.All of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context, creates their foundational expectations of others.The best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationships.If you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong, yet in a familiar way, then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of origin.This realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situations.This type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parents.Expect slow progress and expect more than a few tears.If it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourself.Sending lots of good luck!"
"My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I cant function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but Im terrified to get better because I dont even know who I am without the trauma. Ive never gotten to be myself. I dont even know who I am.",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling. Getting to know yourself after a trauma especially at the hands of a caregiver and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying. I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace. You are not your trauma. You are good and you are whole. Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you.
"My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I dont know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who werent careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?","Without knowing much about your situation, I would encourage you to seek out either a sex therapist who is traumainformed or a trauma therapist who has knowledge about sexual concerns. Even consensual sex can be experienced as an intrusion if a partner was not careful or insensitive to your pain. It would be normal to have some difficulties with sex after such an incident."
"At a friends house, we had some drinks and watched some television. He got up and went to bed. I felt sick. He came out to see if I was okay, and I said no. I said I wanted to go home, and he told me to come lay down. As I laid down on the bed, he started touching me. A friend called me, then I able to leave.",I am so sorry that this happened to you and am so glad that you were able to get away. Your body is yours and yours alone. I would highly recommend that you find a therapist who specializes in treating trauma in order to help you to heal from your ordeal.
"I was kidnapped at fourteen and raped at gunpoint. The guy got six months. When the same thing happened with two friends at nineteen, I didnt even report it.","Wow, Im so sorry that this has happened to you. My heart goes out to you. Please find a therapist who specializes in working with PTSD. Brainspotting, Internal Family Systems Therapy, and Somatic Experiencing are all highly effective therapies for complex interpersonal trauma. If you are interested in reading about trauma from a compassionate and scientific perspective I highly recommend Bessel van der Kolks The Body Keeps the Score."
"I was the one who ended it, and Im so glad I did. It was the best decision I made in my life. But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks? It is creating a wall in my current relationship.","Ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult, especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse. If the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation, you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true. This negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship. The fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse. Good for you!Nightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories, including associated beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations, that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed. There are likely reminderscalled triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences. This is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you. However, you likely feel as if you are not in control. The goal is protect your current relationship, evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings, and begin working on healing your memories of abuse. In many cases, my use of EMDR Eye Movement Desensitizationand Reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories, reduce or eliminate triggers, bring healing, and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship. I would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences, your decision to pursue counseling, and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship. With a good support network in place, healing is very possible."
"I was a victim of an incident. Ive been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because I dont feel anyone honestly believes me. There are so many other factors I deal with on a daily basis. I ignore my problems when Im with my friends, but its scary when Im alone.","As you seemed to have learned, the impact will not just go away. Treatment of trauma is like surgery, it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it. While you are contemplating getting help, you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga. They will aid you when you begin the therapeutic process."
"I know I was molested as a child, but I have no memory of it.","Im not sure that I have the answer to your question, but I can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist. There are a list of them here You also may want to talk to someone who specializes in EMDR. This stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment. I am not trained in this particular method, but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started."
"Im fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be."
"I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like Im always on the edge or just apathetic. Can I fix this by myself?","When it comes to trauma, especially in the event that it has caused you to develop PTSD, there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up. PTSD is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the Cognitive Processing Approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks. As for your other concerns, many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through. Panic attacks and depression, specifically, often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals. The Centre for Clinical Interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks. Whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy, just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma. Hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask."
"As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I cant seem to remember. I also cant remember being with them quite well. Its a blur.","Its important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help. The blur in your memories is your brains attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past. To recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust. When you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories. This will help to lessen the potency of the memory, help to make sense of what has happened, and allow you to begin the healing process. Check into therapist who are trained in EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing."
"My supposetobe father told me to go find my real dad. We havent been getting along since I was a teenager. If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded. He never said I love you. He never gave us hugs. Hes always called me horrible names. I feel hes an evil man with no feelings.","Hi Louisiana, You got it right...hes supposed to be your father. Its tough enough being adopted unless Im reading it wrong, I think youre adopted what you dont need is to be verbally abused by someone whos supposed to love and protect you. I dont know how old you are past teen years though, or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. Its your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. Thats a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing whos going to be in your life. Its tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposedtobe father, but its possible...physical distance avoid him if you dont trust youll be treated with respect, and emotional distance feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability. I think youre already doing that part because you dont blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I dont know if hes evil although I believe evil exists, but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.A good therapist can support you in these goals. I wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult."
My boyfriend is seeking therapy. He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. He has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them.,"Probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents, how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children, and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kids.Dont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured. A relatively qualified therapist would never make this call.Psychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families. You and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children, assuming each of you wants children.Childhood issues, your boyfriends, anyones, are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emerge.If the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents, the disappointments and hurt from the very early years, will be replaced by better ways of interacting."
"An organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies. The study was to implant a fantasy other people are having, but to me, its a nightmare. I lost my kids, my job, and all that. I was an unwilling participant. I no longer trust a therapist. Im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything.","Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will, and all the personal and professional loss that has come since, your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable. There is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed, however, there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause. I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky, given your experiences, and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts, cope with and alleviate the stress that they create, and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves. A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again. If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment, I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress. Some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You may even be able to find some of these resources at a library, if affordability is an obstacle."
I did some horrible sexual things as a kid and I regret everything. Can someone help me cope with myself? Can someone help me remember my past?,"Im very sorry to hear this. Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories. However, keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone.I think regardless, speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial. It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward.In addition, if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise.I wish you the best of luck and I hope you receive the treatment that you deserve."
"Every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. Nothing I do is right, and once shes mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. She says it isnt abuse, its just angry verbal bashing, and that its different. It gets worse each time. The names are very vulgar now.","Im glad that you are reaching out for help. What you are going though sounds overwhelming and exhausting. Here is a link that talks about the signs of an abuse relationship if you are questioning whether or not you are experiencing an abusive relationship maybe a lot of information to take in so if you feel overwhelmed I would encourage you to talk to a therapist. Also every state has a domestic nonprofit that can assist you with support or resources. If you are struggling to find one in your area I can help you. They can help you safety plan and give additional information that might be of assistance. In abusive relationships, unfortunately there is nothing you can do to change your partners behavior. It is up to her to make that decision. A lot of time in abusive relationships asserting your boundaries can put you at risk for more abuse. I would encourage you to use your gut in this situation because you know your relationship better then anyone else. The best thing for you to do is to keep yourself emotionally and physically safe. I would encourage against couples counseling because it can also become unsafe in an abusive relationship. You are making a big step in looking for help."
"My friends husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. He has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. He has held her a prisoner in her home. He has choked her, hit her, etc. She has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. She and I went to a wedding out of town in September of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.","Im glad that you are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend. Im sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isnt much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you dont agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed.Here is some info that might be helpful to you."
"I have an emotionally abusive relationship. We have been together for a year and a half. He got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago, and we have a infant. I love my boyfriend, and I dont want to leave without fighting for this first. Hes an emotionally disconnected person. We never say I love you to each other. Every fight is worse than the last one, and I dont know what to do. He doesnt let me speak because hes louder than me, and that makes me feel frustrated. I have another problem English is my second language. I pay half of the bills, and every time I want to speak to him, he kicks me out of the house. He apologizes sometimes. I feel like Im the only one fighting for this. He agreed to have counseling.","Im glad that you are reaching out for help. All of this sounds overwhelming and confusing. All of what you discribed is common in an abusive relationship. Unfortunately, there isnt anything you can do that will change his behavior. He has to make that decision for himself. It is difficult for abusers to do this because they have to admit that thier behavior is fully thier responsibility. Abusers, a lot of times, will say theyre sorry or make promises to change and then turn around and become abusive again. I would strongly discourage any couples counseling because in an abusive relationship this can become very dangerous for the victim. Individual therapy for both of you you be a safer rout. I would also encourage you to reach out to a domestic violence non profit near you because they can help you safety plan and provide counseling if you want it. Here is some information on the cycle of violence that might be helpful for you hope you are safe and I wish you the best."
"Im a teenager, and throughout my entire life, Ive never really had good parents, or parents at all for that matter. Im not exaggerating. I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school. His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my moms house, and I was so awestricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time. Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. My mom went to prison for that and lost her caf. We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were. My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that persons house. My parents did not get along at this point. We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. He got out of the car, went to the drivers side, and punched my mom in the face. I got out and told him not to hit my mom. At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him. He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. I couldnt even walk. My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. He was so badly strung out on drugs. He went to prison again and seems to be doing well. I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but hes so hard to handle. I think a lot of it is that I cant bring myself to forgive him. My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dads mom the one who lived just down the road because I trust her, her house is stable, and shes more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. I also stay at my boyfriends a lot. Now that my mom is out of prison, shes trying to control every aspect of my life. Shes trying to make me move back home out of Susans house, and I dont want to. I dont like it there. They condone drug abuse and many other things, and Im just not comfortable. Shes even threatened to call the police and say Im a runaway because she has custody of me. My boyfriend has always had this pictureperfect life, and his family are strict Christians. One time, his mom even went as far as to say that if he and I break up, if we were having sex, I would say that he raped me. Ive got so many problems I dont even know what to do.","Thank you for reaching out and I can see that this is getting to the point that it is becoming overwhelming with all that is going on. To address your question, the best answer is that it will take time and from what I read you are still living through it , so your feelings are perfectly normal for the situation. I get the impression that you really need someone to process through all that you have been through and unfortunately getting adequate feedback would best be done meeting one on one with a therapist vs. through a question answer forum. If you are currently in school you could see about meeting with a school therapist or if you are over the age of 15, in most states you can consent to your own therapy. If you choose not to meet with a therapist I would encourage you to call a crisis hotline to help you safety plan to keep yourself safe around your parents 18002738255 If you chose to meet with a therapist keep in mind that a lot of what you experienced can be reported to Family protective services since you are a minor. You can also choose to make a report if you are feeling unsafe with your parents.Im glad to hear that you have your grandmother for support. Im sure this is a lot to take in and I wish you the best."

"My kids dad and I broke up two years ago. He still wants me back, and I just started to fall for him again. But our kids are with Child Protective Services thats why we broke up. He started to talk to other women, and he put his hands on me.",What you are experiencing is common with survivors of abusive relationships. Even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser. A lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children. A lot of time people return to thier abuser because thats the only support that they have. If this is something you are going through I would encourage you to seek out a domestic violence non profit in your area because they can provide you with additional support. I dont know the whole situation but keep in mind that abusers will make promises and say what they think the other person wants to hear to get them to return. Attached is an example of what I am talking about on what you decide I would encourage you to keep caution and boundaries. It might be helpful to safety plan with a domestic violence non profit.
"Im in college currently, so I am not a direct victim anymore. My father is very abusive with his words and actions, and my siblings are getting treated horribly.","Yes you can help! Emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact in your family. It is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist, and maybe help them find one, they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals. Its also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well. If you are concerned about your siblings safety, contact Family Protective Services in your state, they will investigate and refer your father to classes or therapy as needed. It takes courage to do the right thing, you can do this!Hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padre?Actualmente estoy en la universidad, as que no soy victima directamente.

"I am a survivor of domestic violence from a past relationship. Even after seven years, I still have horrible nightmares. I wake up in sweat, and the dreams feel so real.","Nightmare are actually very common for survivors of domestic violence. If they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something, you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist. Another good option, may be to attend a support group for survivors where you could process your memories in a safe space where others will be able to provide support and understanding for what you went through as well as encouragement for the strength it took you to get out of that relationship. You may also want to consider completing a screening or assessment to rule out posttraumatic stress disorder as well."
"After a domestic abuse situation, I went to a therapist, and then my husband went. The therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me. She then told my abuser the results of my tests.","It sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission. There are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however. For example, when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger, he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that person.If you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality, you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory board. The boardwill then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action."
"My husband and I have been together for seven years now. I will be honest I have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. I recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because I was afraid to tell him what happened. Ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. He gets so mad and ignores me for days. Hes really verbally and emotionally abusive. He tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. Should we call it quits? Im tired of crying, but we have a toddler together.","Hi Texas, Thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you. What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you, and then you ask Should we call it quits?. We? I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together.The way your husband treats you is not your fault, Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trust.Theres an analogy that I sometimes use I dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but its powerful either way, so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying, it has lost its strength.Its called learned helplessness. When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you.You have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. In my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse.This is a complex picture, and if you were my client, I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child.I sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist. I wish you the best."
"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and thats when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I havent had the courage to leave him, and theres really nothing stopping me now. I dont live with him, I dont depend on him, and we dont have children. We both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I dont ever make the effort to try to be okay. Ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control, so thats not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?","Hi Winters, I learned a long time ago that I cant ever predict who will change and who wont. I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work, and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change. But in reading your story, the image of a slot machine came to mind. Youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change. Only you can decide how many years to give it. I see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though. What are you waiting for?Although you say you know his behaviours arent your fault, something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change. It doesnt work that way. Just like the slot machine, you have no power to change him or make this work. You can only decide when youve paid too much.I bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you. Hes not your only support."
"I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because Ive never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think Im about to lose her, if I already havent. I throw things at her when Im angry, and sometimes I hit her. I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her. I dont want to lose her, and I dont want the situation to worsen. I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood. Im ready to change. I need help now. Im about to explode.","Hi Baton Rouge,Im glad youre reaching out. The first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours. I do hear you minimizing your actions you say you dont hit her enough to cause harm?, but youre headed in the right direction.I hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm youre causing isnt just superficial bruising. The effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds. Please seek treatment for yourself immediately.You say you love your girlfriend? Do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues? Are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partner?You have dangerous habits because you dont know how to manage your own emotional pain. You can unlearn this and it doesnt mean youre a bad person. Sometimes, however, the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended, for both of your sakes, because too much damage has been done.I know you dont want to lose her, but you dont own her, and you dont have the right to trap her in this because youre afraid of being alone. Right now, she needs some space to figure out whats best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants.This is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort. I wish you well."
"Ive been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything. Im always there when he needs my help. He tells me although I help him doesnt mean that I am a good person. He always discredits me as a woman and its hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.","That sounds like a very hurtful situation. Unfortunately, without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop. I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation, and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship. There is help out there and you are not alone. If you need any additional resources in your area, please dont hesitate to contact me."
"I have a child with my baby mother. She works I take care of our young son. She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting me down, telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me, but then the next day after our fight she says she does. Im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops. Now me and my family dont talk. Shes always telling me Im annoying and just belittles me. Nothing I do is right. She says I work you watch the baby. On her days off she never cooks or cleans. I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says hes not any thing to her. What do I do? I dont want to leave.","It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child. So if the abuse continues, it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move out.On the other hand, if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state, you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging. It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship. Although your question revealed just a short bit of information, I didnt read about any positives in the relationship.Sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you. However, with time and focus you can do it. Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your child.However, if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship, you have to be upfront with her. You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you. This gives her a chance to render the situation. If after this there is no improvement, I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stay.I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy. Are there any hobbies you enjoy? Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents? Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit.It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family. You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend, especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately.Thank you for reaching out. I wish you the best of luck with your relationship."
"Ive known my boyfriend for several years. We were friends for a long time. In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didnt seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan. After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasnt apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. I dont know what to do.","There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withSeveral breakupsNot holding up his end of the bargain regarding workLack of empathy for your miscarriageLying about his involvement with another womanPhysical violence, which is of most concern.This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. In my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone, it is indefensible. You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, Is this really someone I want to marry? Is he an asset to my life? I think youll realize he is not.Best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect."
Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?,"I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware.There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries Where You End and I Begin."
I snap easy and push people away. I need help before I push my boyfriend away.,"Death of someone with whom we had fond involvement, is sad. Accepting that a person is permanently gone from this earth, is unsettling and can feel painful.That you had no current contact with this person doesnt exclude the meaning or feelings from within your relationship with this person. Relationships dont require a time measurement in order to affect us. Your question acknowledges the process of adjusting to life without the chance to see or hear from this person again.It is normal to grieve so be gentle and not critical of yourself when you feel yourself missing this person."
My roommate is a unapologetic person who doesnt care who she hurts. She never apologizes to me or my family. She made me lose my temper today to the point where I was using swear words in front of my mom and brother.,"You must be feeling frustrated about how to resolve this. Some people seem to really provoke emotional responses in us. One thing to learn for a quick review of yourself when you are provoked is to pay attention to your body.Notice your heart rate, fists clenched, some warmth going through your body and these are signs that the interaction is toxic for you. Move out of the room, say something calling to both of you and let things simmer down before responding.When you are able to calm your body, think of ways to bring the issue to her attention using positive words but holding your ground. If she doesnt listen ask someone to come with you to talk to her about it, If she still wont listen, reassess your expectations of her.Finally if you need to , you may have to consider changing the status of your rooming together."
I get angry and act out. It scares my wife and child.,"Anger is a normal emotion, no different than joy, elation, or sadness. Its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble. Being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict, and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations. There are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode, and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations, they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them, they just impulsively respond. I would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a Cognitive Behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior. In addition, I would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed. The first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing, which you have, now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion, and communicate that youre angry. Remember, anger is the overt expression of some other emotion i.e., disappointment, hurt, frustration, etc.. Hope this helps..."
"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious. I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","Anger does have its place. When anger is experienced often or the magnitude of it does not fit the scenario, such as your losing comb, the question becomes, what does losing that comb mean to you? In the very split second that you have realized the comb is missing, there is a reaction that occurs within you, accompanied by an image or thought that like lightening flashes so quickly that you may not be aware what it is. As Sherry noted below, awareness. Awareness is fundamental. Becoming aware of ourselves and what is happening internal that sparks it off. The next time you feel angry from a small thing, stop and ask yourself, why am I angry that this is lost? Find out what you are thinking or how you are speaking to yourself. You will become aware and once you are aware, steps can be taken to alter the experience for the better. A professional can assist with that!"
Were in an eight year relationship. My boyfriend drinks a lot. He experienced childhood trauma. I dont know how to deal with violent outbursts.,"You shouldnt need to educate yourself on violent outbursts. He is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts. They are his behavior, not yours. All youre trying to do is have a relationship with this guy.The one task to do is during a quiet time to tell your boyfriend the way you feel about his outbursts.His answer, whether he denies having a problem, blames you for his problem, tells you the problem isnt so bad, why are you complaining, tells you a lot about his willingness to change.Whether or not he considers himself to have a problem and wants to change himself, is very good for you to know.This tells you what to expect from him in future. You can reflect and plan ahead for your own life depending on your tolerance and willingness to live with what he answers you."
"Any time things get heated, the past gets brought up. I raise my voice at her to try to get a point across. She asks openended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me. Shes seven months pregnant. I have drank in the past, but Im not dependent on alcoholI only drink at social events.","Have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past, in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of you?Since your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them. The more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible moments.If you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control, then try scheduling a discussion about them. This by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about."
"When I got home, my boyfriend and I got into an argument. He got upset and he started hitting his face. That is the first time he has ever done that, but I would be lying if I said that didnt scare me. I locked myself in the room.","Sounds scary to watch. I agree with you!Maybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger, hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotions.Now that the incident is past, bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss it.Just the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time, may be restorative to him.At the very least, you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place!"
I get really mad easily at my parents and family.,"Anger is not necessarily a bad thing. If you are angry and you can talk about your feelings, that would be very helpful. Anger usually comes along with something else, like feeling sad, worried, overwhelmed, confused, and many others. Consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point. If you get along well with friends and dont get angry with them, look at the differences. Do you feel criticized by your parents or family? Misunderstood? There could be any number of things.I wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly. Try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry. Anger is a real emotion in itself. It almost always connects to something else as well."
My longterm girlfriend broke up with me recently. She says its because of my anger.,"I need help controlling my anger.Anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues. Anger also helps us understand that theres something wrong that needs to change. Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger.Ask yourself Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc.? Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and whats your reaction. Then explore how else you could respond or react. You could use Istatements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario. This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggressionand learn to manage our anger before we act on it. Anger is a feeling aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically. Find ways to vent crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry. Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.Necesito ayuda para controlar mi coraje.El coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos. El coraje tambin nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar. Cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuente.Pregntate a ti mismo Por qu tengo coraje, estoy herido, decepcionado, confundido, avergonzado, etc.? Ya que encuentres la respuesta, explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reaccin. Luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasin. Puedes usar expresiones del Yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situacin. Esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu Consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploracin.Tambin es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresin, y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos. El coraje es un sentimiento y la agresin es cuando expresas tu coraje agrediendo a alguien, fsica, emocional o sicolgicamente.

"My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams. Not violent like hes hurting someone, but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones. He explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening. It was far beyond anything in a horror movie, he says he cant help these thoughts they just pop up. Please help!","If your son is reporting extremely violent thoughts and dreams please have an psychological evaluation done by a psychiatrist now before it gets even worse for him to bare. Dont take his reports lightly. For him to tell you, he knows that something is not right. He is seeking and needing help. Get it immediately. Best to be safe than sorry."
"I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soontobe husband. I think his mood and rageanger problems have rubbed off on me a lot. I dont get nearly as bad as he does, but I yell almost constantly and I cant seem to just stop. I have two young babies that have to hear this, and I dont want my girls growing up with a mommy like I have been lately. I just dont know how to get back to my old self.","With me knowing thata healthy relationshipusually includes respect, trust, appreciation, companionship, spiritual solidarity, domestic support, feeling of being cherished, and sensuous affection, I am wondering if you are lacking in several if not all of these needs in your present relationship. Before he becomes your husband, you should examine these areas and see if they are high in rating. Otherwise, yes this relationship will affect your girls and you negatively. I would suggest relationship counseling, specifically premarital. Not be surprised if through the process you realize that this relationship is not the best choice for you and your children."
"I have not been able to really sleep. I stay up all times of the night not even knowing why. Every day, I feel like I have anger inside of me. I have a little family, but I cant open up to them like I want to. I have a son, and I feel that I take my anger out on him by screaming at him.","Best question is....what are you so angry about? You cant stop being so angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger. If you feel like you have anger inside, while I am sure you do. Taking it out on your son is only passing on the hurt and anger. This will be inside him too. Get some professional help so that you can be happy and have a happy child."
"My issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act. I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent, not me. I dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment.","Knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel, are fine qualities.Anger, whatever the magnitude, generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into words.Try thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such times.Also, if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk, you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations. Even without drinking, the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memory.If this describes part of your childhood, then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express."
"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, selfobservation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind. Once youre able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, youd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and youre hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time youll have in handling comments from others that youre not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because youd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process youre placing yourself."
I dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger. Thats really the only one i feel.,"Well, then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you have!What is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings? Your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feel.Sometimes the family in which someone grew up, did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they were.In some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind. By knowing where your difficulties started, you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelings.Also, spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are. Often, people who have difficulty in expressing themselves, suffered shame and humiliation as a child. They have a chronic sense of worthlessness, and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression. By having a good time being with yourself, you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating."
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter."
"I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges. I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was. I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine. I have these urges to hurt someone really bad. I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting. I want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices. What is wrong with me?","What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describe?Maybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions, with how you would wish to feel from relating to others.Since you ask, what is wrong with me?, there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in return.This is true even with imagining doing harm to others.What are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting others?Besides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors, what gain which is not evil, do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being?"
"I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I dont mean to be that way, but I cant help it.","A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves. A surface situation, like, a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesnt have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions, youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear, are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!"
"I am so angry. I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I dont know what to do. I want to sit down with a psychologist, but I cannot afford one, nor do I have my own health insurance. I can feel myself starting to get violent. I throw things of value when I start to get mad. I have punched holes in my wall. I can feel my aggression getting worse.","First off, it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made. It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from. Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope withlifes obstacles, including anger management. There are several strategies that you can try tohelp control your anger, but theones thatI would recomend first are the following1.Try a different way of communicating with your parents. Sincearguing withthem is a great source of anger for you, learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit.Choose a time to talk with themabout heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. Use I phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you, as opposed to placing blame on them.Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.2. When you feel yourself becoming angry, take a break. Simply excuse yourself from the situation, find a quiet place to be by yourself, and do some deep breathing. Close your eyes, slowly count to four as you inhale, and exhaleeven slower, counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset, we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid, then let them go and replace them with realistic, logical thoughts.4. Finally, find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal. Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.I wish you all the best!"
"I dont know whats with me. Im almost constantly angry. Even when Im happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didnt, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. Its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","Hi Nashville, Im glad you want this to be different. It doesnt feel good to be angry all the time, and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, Im sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. Its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that.So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, youd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is. In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...its that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with. You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them."
"When I see something I dont like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from 0 to 100 really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6, while focusing and thinkingonly about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!"
"Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when hes mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like were so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? Weve been married for two years but together for seven.","Hi, Newark. It sounds to me like your husband is going through something, and I think you understand that. You might feel very helpless, sad, and disrespected at the same time. Hes changed.Its unfair for him to blame you for his emotions. His mood issues are about him, not you, and hes either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it.Are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries? You can let him know when you feel disrespected, and whats not okay with you.He may be experiencing depression, which often shows up as irritability in men. It could be that hes not telling you something, or hes unaware of his emotional processes. You can try a Im really worried about you. You dont seem happy and I dont know how to help you. Some things are happening that arent okay with me. Will you see a therapist? approach. Perhaps you could go with him the first time?Its about a combination of compassion, selfrespect and seeking professional help, I believe. I wish you well."
"Im a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get selfdestructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I dont live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I dont know how to control it. Its over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I couldnt get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and its always over stupid, petty things.","Hi. Im glad you wrote. In general, when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us, its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past, and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectively...we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively. You say that your behaviours are self destructive, and I agree. It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm, and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem. This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you. Again, a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm. Your feelings are normal, and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help."
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"I suggest that you work on emotional awareness.Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say I am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern.It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience."
I have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month.,"Theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpful.Since we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening, we try to alter them while we are in a waking state.In a nutshell, this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have. Typically, there is an element of fear, danger or helplessness.Second, we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment, control, competence, andor safety. In other words, if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted, we might change the events of the story so that you call the police, get to a place of safety, or even fight back and protect yourself.Third, you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again, so that it becomes a well rehearsed story. The effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping, this new, more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream. Best of luck!"
"I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two. It usually happens in bed at night, but I occasionally experience this during the day. I have a benign brain tumor, but the doctor said it is not associated with this.","Im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening. I know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition, but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician? Ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature. As far as the out of body experience, there are different stages of sleep, so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream, you may not be fully awake when its going on. These are just some thoughts, but I think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start."
"Im a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I dont even know if hes sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. Ive either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so Im always tired. I live in a small town, so theres no one I can really talk to because Im not really that close with my family.","Hello, and thank you for your question. You are clearly aresourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. Ihave a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too.First, good for you for taking care of yourself and makingreally good decisions such as not getting into the car with dad when he isintoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above allelse. To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common forpeople to blame themselves for other peoples actions. There are variousreasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to thatperson, past experiences, and our selfesteem, we may actually start to believeit. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibilityto be sure that you are safe andcared for, not the other way around. As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about bothyour physical and emotional safety and wellbeing. It sounds like your fatherhas an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling withaddiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying todeal with things like school. You may want to see if your school has a counselor orsomeone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in somestates, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have toreport to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concernedabout that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. If you dont know a counselor, think about any other adultthat you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas. Sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines orhotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be ableto find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing randomsearches, not every website is good, so be careful. This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of thethings that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus ontaking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down andwe stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. Ifyou have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard aboutthings, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take careof yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help whenwe get stressed. I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"It takes me a long time to fall asleep Id estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe. I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning. After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?","Youre noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep, thereis quite a bit going on, which may be anxiety related. It sounds like thedreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you hadaround the time of your break up, the difficulty with your fathers business,and your mothers health issues. These connections to past events may beimportant insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more aboutwhat your dreams may be trying to tell you. There is no exact science todreams, but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates tosignificant themes in their lives. I think that exploring these issues further witha therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress, trouble sleeping, and frightening dreams."
"Ive pretty much been on my own since day one, Im a middle child of five, and I cant seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.","One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate. Youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of selfreminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work."
I have been married for 11 years. Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. I feel very alone and just uncared for. Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected?,"Your question highlights your pain very clearly.What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward.My mind immediately goes to a question for you What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship? What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need? Does this lead to arguments? Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship, and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging. Regardless of who started it, these patterns canturn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. As the patternsslow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. The book Hold Me Tight 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love by Sue Johnson is a selfhelp book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists, and has been helpful to many couples that I see. When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy such as Emotionally Focused Therapy. You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here summarizeYour pain is understandable and valid. Its telling you what you are missing and what you want.Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wantsneeds,while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, thats fantastic! If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated. Pain means this is important! You and your marriage are worth the effort!"
"For some reason I feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media. I know she is proud of her body and I respect that, but I dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does. Anytime I bring it up to her she thinks Im calling her a whore. How can I deal with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media and not hurt her feelings?","Ask her to consider your feelings not only her own defensiveness that she is called a whore by you.Clearly since youre writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance, you do not consider your gf to be a whore.She may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body. In the end she may not want the privacy over her body which you are encouraging her to have.At least you will have the satisfaction to know you stated your actual reasons for your request, and did not rely on the ones she imagined you have."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me. He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now Im craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory, I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common. It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions, and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really, we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels. That being said, it also lowers our ability to make well thoughtout decisions. This combined with the brain rewarding novelty new lover, new experience with our partner etc. and maybe even some overzealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you. My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage. Now, IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening, I would definitely push the issue and see whats up from his perspective.The empty feeling could be any number of things includingFear that youre not enough for himFear that shes better than you in some wayFear that if we keep doing this thing, he will need it and what happens if I no longer want it?Opposite fear of what if I now want her more than him or if I want the threesomes and he doesnt?Fear of does this mean our sex life isnt good enough as it is?....do we have to always add a little spice to keep it hot?Or like Robin alluded to, preconceived notions about what culture, religion, family and friends etc. say about what marriage and sex should look like. I also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in there...jealousy? insecurity? shame? regret? longing? When you can identify and name them, they are easier handled.

"I have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times. I pretend we arent married at my work. Recently, he has caught on, but I lie to cover it. He use to talk to girls online, but I have caught myself constantly having a affair.",Whether to divorce or not depends on your reasoning to do so.Marriage is its own unique existence dependent on what the partners want from it.Examine your terms of satisfaction from the marriage.Maybe you have very clear reasons to continue the marriage.Maybe you dont.Only you can decide if what youre contributing and benefitting is satisfying enough to stay.
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","There are many different ways that can be approached in your situation.1. I would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test. i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex drive.2. Where is your husband in this situation? Is he resentful, accepting, demanding or neutral?3. What is your past sexual history? has this had an affect on your current issue?4.Has there been problems in your past with abuse of any kind?5. Understand that intimacy is more than sex. What other ways can you be close to your spouse?6. It sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of you.Couples counseling would be a great place to start.All of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be established.You need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse."
"My spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in Amsterdam. After he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds. In the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened, from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute. How do I know if he had sex?","Unfortunately, you will never know the true answer. This is really frustrating to hear, but you will never 100 be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth. So if you can, work on accepting that, breathing through that,He may not fully remember, he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now. He may have been honest then or he may be honest not.As for options, you can talk to him and provide a safe space for him to tell you what happened. This could be a private conversation with you or at a counseling session. He would need to feel safe to tell you the truth. But remember, there are no guarantees. You would need to make a decision to trust him or not. And go from there. A couples counselor can help guide that conversation, and make sure that he is feeling safe to share.More important than if he actually had sex or not, I would evaluate your relationship. Do you trust him now? Were there trust issues before? Does he hide things now? Identifying your current trust levels will be important for having a healthy relationship now. Hope this helps, even if it is frustrating to not have guarantees."
"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.","Strengthen your own belief in your right to a decent life and respect of who you are.From the brief description you write, your husband has very limited capacity to recognize how others feel and even less capacity to empathize with the person.The best you can do is convince yourself of your own worth and associate with others who believe similarly about your qualities."
"My fianc and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good. The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me. I recently found out he cheated on me with another women. He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do. Is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should I just move on?","Infidelity is common. In a largest study conducted to date about 1015 of women and 2025 of men admitted to being unfaithful while in a monogamous relationship. You are not alone and you can get through this just like countless couples have done before you. First of all, you need to know that although there may be reasons for his behaviour e.g., not feeling sexually satisfied those are not excuses. He could have chosen to masturbate instead of cheating on you, right? Your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger, more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you, then there is hope. The question is are you willing to put in all this extra work? Forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again. It wont just happen if you dont work on it. And yes, its unfair that you are being asked to work on this, when he is the one who had been unfaithful. Even though it is hard, you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship, because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on. You cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun. All of this is hard work. Is he and this relationship worth it? Are you equally committed to making it work? If so, dont abandon this relationship just yet. Work on it together ideally get a few sessions with an experienced couple counsellor and see where that gets you.

"I was with my friends at the park, and we were talking and having fun. After a while, I met a girl there. We talked and flirted for a while, then we gave our numbers to each other and left. We talked for a few months, then we met up again. She kissed me, so I assumed we were dating. Then I found out she has a boyfriend.","Im sorry for your disappointment with this girl.Maybe next time you start to like someone talk with the person to find out if they feel similar to you. This way you have a good chance to avoid being hurt in the way you describe here.Even if the person doesnt give you a straightforward answer to their feelings for you, youll gain a little more information by listening to how seriously they consider your question, what their body language is like, whether or not the person seems sincere.Listen to your gut.If you feel unsure the person likes you as much as you like them, then wait a little while to see if your feelings about the person or their feelings about you, change and in what direction they change.Keep yourself informed as best you can so youll know you did as much as possible to kiss someone who understands your kiss the way you mean it to be understood."
"Hes gone for 11 weeks for a band camp. Its week two right now. We used to be Intimate a lot, and now since hes busy 12 hours a day, we cant really be Intimate, even over the phone. Is it normal for me to more sensitive in general?","Well yes, physical intimacy does give all sorts of positive feelings. The sudden withdrawal of these is certainly possible to trigger a reaction like the one you describe."
"My husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in November. She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. I wasnt aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was. He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night. The next morning, we talked about going to counseling. He went out that night with friends and said his exwife wasnt going. I found out in April that she did go. I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open. I found out that he stayed that second night with her. I asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights. His daughter wasnt there the second night. He claims they didnt have sex, but what else should I think?","I agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationship.Your husband may not know, want to know or want to discuss with you, what his true feelings are toward you and the ex.The topic is very heated, which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than good,Usually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happen.In a therapist office, the two of you will be guided on talking about these critical areas and this will be much more productive than trying to do so only with the two of you."
"Shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We dont talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we dont know how.","Maybe your girlfriend feels torn in her emotions between loyalty toward her family and toward investing herself in a relationship.There are so many maybes, that the best way to strengthen your relationship is to ask your girlfriend if she feels any pressure from her family to avoid involving herself with you.If the answer is no, then continue to talk with each other as to what would make you each feel more secure with one another.Also, more simply, are the two of you able to resolve the little fights?Differences of opinion are normal between two people, even to the point of each person feeling they are the only one who knows the correct answer.As long as each one of you has the goodwill to give a little, then the fights are a healthy way to respect and care about each other.If the fights are about the same topic which repeats itself, then there are strong differences between the two of you, including the possibility that her family places and she is willing to accept, some obstacle to this relationship."
"I went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide. When I went to him to reach out to his high school friend, he told me that I put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders. He was very angry that I went to him to do that. Am I in the wrong for going to him to reach out? He helped me so much with my depression and bad habits, so thats why I thought of him to reach out. He made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help. Why did he react this way towards me? I think hes being selfish.","Your compassionate reach out to the friend is praiseworthy.That your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearly.I believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your action.However, he is mixing up his own responsibility to know the root of his feelings.Blaming you for feelings he doesnt understand within himself is unfair and not helpful to anyone, including him.From what you write, you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was gracious.My only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior is that he doesnt yet fully understand himself and finds blaming others easier than understanding himself."
"He told me he started to back away because I was asking for too much in the relationship. The more I tried to fix things, the worse it got. I want to make us better again, but I dont know how.",Have you asked your boyfriend directly this question?It is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other.
"My boyfriend has this close female friend. It always bothered me because of how close they are, so I decided to meet her. That made the situation worse because they were even closer than what I thought. They acted like a couple rather than friends with each other. There was no physical interaction, but he talks to this girl a lot. What can I do? Leaving him isnt an option.","I wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling. A few things may help with thatTry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important for example, not during a commercial for a TV showMaybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience, kind of like an investigative reporter wouldSee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youRemember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesAlso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesThen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example, what it is that he likes about herAlso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion, discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between 15 minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionRemember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through, not to find a solution right awayThis can be difficult. Consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together."
"Im a man, and Im soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but its been happening a lot. I dont know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? Whatkind of characterdo I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also valueauthenticityas something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your valuesand living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I wont lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someones fianc.Above all, I wish you well in this journey.

"She has lied about every aspect of her life. Shes created three fake relationships. The most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos, phone calls, and text messages, and its with a married man with kids. Her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives.","Is being friends with this person safe for you?Liars dont generally distinguish who they bring down with them or in service to themselves.Step one is to understand a true friendship, which is based on trust, is probably not possible with this person.If youd like to offer words of advice to protect her from herself then try gently pointing out that some of her actions which you know about, may come around to harm her.There is only a small chance she will be open to hearing you.People who lie are also very fearful of trusting others, including themselves. She may prefer to keep status quo than open her own emotional pain to understand what created the need to lie in the first place."
"My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide. He says that because his dad died, so did his heart. He says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again. Why is he doing this when we were very happy together? He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me.","I am sorry to learn of this. You must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken. To begin, he is correct. You have done nothing wrong. This is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive. It is fear. It is anger. It is extreme sadness. It is feelings of abandonment. It is intense emotional pain. It is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional loss.I am not familiar with how old this post is, but often, it will require time and understanding. If he speaks with you, encourage him to get grief counseling. Do not encourage it for your relationship, encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad. Start there. Good Luck."
"Ever since my exboyfriend and I broke up, I cant seem to get close to anyone else. I know Im completely over him, but I just cant break down my walls and let someone new into my life.","Hi Bend, Youre scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt. Who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines 90 of our happiness in life.The good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and thats okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person.First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like No one will ever love me again?, or Im going to get hurt again, or I cant trust myself? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. Its simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually, with time."
"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationshipnot because of your boyfriends silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always."
"My husband cheated while I was pregnant with our son with a socalled friend. This was before we were married. We split and eventually worked things out. I thought I trusted him so we got married. Now he flirts with girls in front of me. Ive talked to him, but nothing helps.","This sounds very painful for you.Are you able to tell him how his flirting affects you?Maybe he doesnt care enough to change, and maybe he does.Long term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices, put up with it, which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship. Or, of course, you can decide to end the relationship. This choice is quite significant now that you have a child together. Give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome."
"The father of my kids and I have been broken up for about three years now. We always found our way back to each other. He had a baby with someone else hes with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when hes around. He even gets jealous, but he ignores my calls.",Your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointment.You know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd like.It is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothing.Reflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wish.Depending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been.
"Every day for five years, my husband mentally abused me and said he will change. I have a child with him. I try so hard to stay strong for her, but at this point, I am completely broken. I am holding on to nothing but hope and have been for years. Is there any hope or am I wasting my time?","I think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationship.Be glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband does.For support and guidance in real time, look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationships.You are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner. Having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man."
"My boyfriend and I have been disagreeing on a lot lately. Its really coming down to the fact that we want opposite things sometimes. I do a lot for him I take care and protect him, and in the end, he still doesnt trust me. Weve both come to the conclusion that when I want something and he doesnt want it, hes not willing to find a happy medium whatsoever. Its just nonnegotiable. Im not sure what to do honestly. He doesnt trust me as much as I wish he did. Honestly, sometimes I feel like his enemy, and it kills me.","Theres a difference between what you want, what you need and what you have. Being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation. Often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectively.You could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution.Mi novio no transa conmigoltimamente, mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos. Todo se debe al hecho de quequeremos cosas diferentes. Yo hago mucho por l, lo cuido y protejo, y al final, el no confa en m. Ambos hemos llegado a la conclusin que cuando yo quiero algo que l no quiere, l no est dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio. No es negociable. No estoy segura de que hacer. El no confa en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera, a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata.Hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres, lo que necesitas y lo que tienes. Poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relacin te ayudara en los momentos de negociacin. Muchas veces las parejas se enfocan en recontar todos los problemas y caractersticas negativas a la hora de negociar, y eso les impide hablar claramente del problema presente e identificar soluciones especficas.Pueden usar la mediacin de parejas para aprender tcnicas de comunicacin asertiva y tener asistencia filtrando e identificando la informacin que les ayudara a resolved o negociar una solucin al problema."
"I have been pushing people away all my life. I finally have a great boyfriend who loves me, but I keep pushing him away and I dont want to. I need to learn to open up.","Figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task. But it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that. Pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life. Or it may be serving some other purpose. One helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist. Psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the pushing away is serving. It also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction. What were you feeling right before this? Did it provide relief? Reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the pushing away serves.It may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times. This may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship, and to understand what may be happening when you push him away."
"I have been dating my boyfriend for eight years. We met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when I met his family who treats him like he is their man. They expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around, and he thinks its okay.","Well, then you learned something new about your boyfriend!Are you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying together.Think over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationship.There are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationship.The key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to live.Also, an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion. He may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you."
"Hes lied about his pastpresent situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I dont trust him all too much, but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently.",Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.
"My fianc of 15 years is always helping out his family, and I feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness. Were about to get married this Saturday, but I feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids. I am not enjoying our engagement at all.","Congrats on your upcoming wedding!Have you told the thoughts you write here, to your fianc ?This is the place to start since you clearly are unhappy with a part of his and now your life, which will be with you for quite some time."
"The eight months Ive been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he wont believe, even if Im being honest. I dont know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship."
"Someone I care about told me Im not teachable and Im irritating. I just want to be happy and wanted to please the person, but I always fall short it seems.","Pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying. If the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfying.Offering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe here.Tell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtful.If the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelings.Keep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them. Some people, sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person."
"Ive been in a relationship for almost a year, and I absolutely trust my boyfriend. He treats me nice, checks on me, and tells me sweet things. However, when it comes to making life decisions, I feel he is very immature. I try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together, but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting. As far as dates, if I dont say anything, plan it, or have money to chip in, we will not go. I feel like I put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling, and all I get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion.","Well, then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or not.One point to keep in mind is this.Just because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinions.In the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesnt tell you what is in their mind.Short term it seems easy to have someone agreeable.Long term someone who doesnt tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you, may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways."
"My best friend and Ive been really close for almost three years. She lives in the UK, and I live in the US. Ever since her boyfriend flew from Oregon to Scotland, Ive been angry at him. Ever since he came into her life, he took her away from me. My best friend would always say sorry, and Im sick of it.","You are definitely in a frustrating situation.Your friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship. Being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends, is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurt.If you feel you would like to one more time tell your friend that you miss your friendship with her and would like her attention, then do so.After expressing your needs as much as possible and if the result doesnt change, then the sad conclusion is that your friend is willing to give you less time and energy than you require from her."
"I found the guy Im dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and Im the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","Tell him what you know and ask why he is lying to you. If he tells you he isnt lying and you have proof that he is, then you can either accept that he denies the truth or not."
"My boyfriend wont touch me intimately, he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me. I know he has done this things with other women in the past. I dont know why he wont do them with me. What should I do?","First off, dont blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions. Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time.There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner thats left him scared to try again we call this operant conditioning. It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers. Sometimes I refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal. Drives many partners crazy until theyre aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them.It could also be that hes not even aware that hes not doing these things. If you havent asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when youre not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy. You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him. Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if hed be down to go downtown. Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.If you continue to get the impression that its somehow only about YOU or that hes just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if hed be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy."
"He said that if I were to visit my mother, he will be gone when I get back. My boyfriend and I hit a rough patch in our relationship a few months back, and my mom had a few choice words with him.","Your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother. By trying to control whether or not you visit your mom, unless you are in agreement with this, is building tension between you and him.Ask why he resents your interest to see your mother.If he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him, then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward him.If something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago, then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother."
Im 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because Im attracted to her and shes under 18?,"You are not a pedophile. You are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship. There would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger.Pedophelia, is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about. I would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this."
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be upfront about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I dont really think that its necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after youve known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this.It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone longterm, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdress.Id also ask you to consider this Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questionsWhat exactly is crossdressing?Does that change the gender that youre attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful."
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this. A while back 3 years ago, I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didnt like this. For our New Years resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on boardno more drinking every night. The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing, but I couldnt wait. I asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking. He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. Im not sure if Im overreacting or not. I just feel like Im so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that youre upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters. His ignoring of what youre talking about, doesnt mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing. He doesnt sound like this, at least now."
I love my girlfriend so much. I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her. But the two times we tried to have sex I couldnt get an erection. Weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago. Why this is happening and what can I do about it?,"Im sorry to hear of your problem.First step as always when a possible medical explanation exists, go for a urology check up to either your internist or a urologist.Once you know there is no medical reason which would prevent an erection, then we can consider the psychological and emotion based factors.Maybe youre nervous about your sexual performance or that your gf may be disappointed in your performance.Men often mistake their own fears of performance failure with the assumption that their partner thinks about sex as a performance.Talk with your gf about whatever is on your mind which may inhibit you from enjoying sex.The reasons are endless.What matters is to have a heartfelt dialogue with each other.The emotional support which comes through such an intimate conversation may very well be the catalyst for a more relaxed and satisfying approach to sex w your gf."
"My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. The next day, she kicked me out. She let me move back two days later. Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. I asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says its not my business.","When threats of leaving, such as what you described in your question kicking you out, wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage, it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship, impacting both partners. And, if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship, and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife, its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship.From the information provided in your question, it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship. Avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship. If your wife is willing, I would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time. Or, for you to talk with an individual therapist, if marriage counseling isnt an option."
"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive. I love him so much. Why do I do this?","I sympathize with you! It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other, and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is, there are ways to deal with this.You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter ones sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this, talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control, such as condoms.However, there are some other things to ask yourself. First, you used the term affection but then talked about sex. Theyre not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy, and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is The Five Love Languages.Defining what affection means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.Humans are hardwired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newbornspremies who can receive skinonskin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who dont receive this touch. Its called Kangaroo Care.Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where theyre not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when theyre adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here.For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexualphysical touch sexual abuse, physical beatings it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if youve been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a nonsexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you dont even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other persons chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate.If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples."
"Im trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I dont think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?","Do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about? Think about it for a minute. Do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female coworkers your husband has? And if so, what does that say about your marriage? Trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with its also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common. If you are focused on every little detail around your relationship, it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more. If instead you focus on opening the lines of communication, let him know what you expect from him, and discuss how you could both build trust again, you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow. Debera este molesta porque mi esposo me minti de nuevo?Estoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione despus de una separacin. Antes de separarnos el menta mucho y rompa todas sus promesas.

"My fiance is always letting me know how I am a horribleevil person, or I just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day.","I dont know much about the dynamics of your relationship, but I want to say that you cannot possibly be responsible for anyone elses happiness. If you are interested in a good read on this topic, I highly recommend The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz."
"My fianc and I recently had an argument over finances. He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance. He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy. He realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why I was allowing him to continue to do that since I was physically paying it for him. My response was that he was giving me the money, and I just made the payment. I didnt think of the coverages. He was angry about it. I still cant figure out that anger.","Id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities, than about the anger per se.What you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior, which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilities.Start by withdrawing yourself from paying his bills.If he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy, then surely the only one for him to blame will be himself.Stay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountable.Tell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you."
"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","The comments here from the other therapists are spot on. As a Certified Sex Addiction TherapistCandidate Im convinced your partners acting out creates trauma for you. Your partners addiction is NOT your fault and his recovery IS his responsibility. Whats paramount is for you to get immediate help from an experienced therapist who understands trauma as result of the partnersspouses problematic sexual behaviors. Your needs, safety, and the establishment of reasonable boundaries is vital to your wellbeing. I wish you the very best.Resources for Your Consideration 1 2 3"
"Im feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage. If your husband was to work with me Id explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others.Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, Id challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP primary care physician andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin storyline regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories."
"We have been together over a year. We spend time together every day no matter how busy. He started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight. He also began to be distant and sexually selfish. We had a argument, and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer. He wont treat it.","I wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want, wish for, and desire from one another right now. That doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for, but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him, since traditional medical treatment is not something he wants.You may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship. Both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one another.I would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone else.It may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones."
"Im in a relationship with my childs father. Im a really jealous person. We dont go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I cant. How can I get over these issues?","It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it. If youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous, I dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.Also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.Also, consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this. You cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?"
"Im in my early 20s, and Ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. He has made comments such as you would look better as a Tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats. Its really hurtful.","My first thought was that I wondered what changed recently. Is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that one?Its possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts you.Try asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important. I dont know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year, but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument, you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly. Then you can listen to his side of the concern."
"My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriendslovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because Im afraid they might reconnect somehow. Ive attempted to talk to her about it, but she avoids it and doesnt seem to worry about how I feel about it.","Talking about it would probably be helpful if youre both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important. It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time. You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you. After one of you is talking, perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say. This can lessen confusion.I know you say that she avoids it. It might be a good place to start talking about it to see what makes her avoid it. It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them. I dont know how you typically react when you are jealous, but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing, that may be helpful as well."
Nothing weve tried has worked so far.,"Sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum. If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend, you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy. You could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable. After doing this for nonsexual touching, it can also be used with sexual touching. Looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help."
She works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out.,"I wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about. This can often change the way that we look at different situations. Try to look at what feelings, for you when you notice that someone is checking her out, and perhaps when you have felt these feelings before.If you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation, perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you. Then you could talk about feelings that youre having."
"My wife works late most days, so Im lonely. I love my wife with all my heart, however I dont feel the intimacy we used to have. We dont have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. I have become close friends with a coworker, which I know is not helping. Nothing will happen with that, but theres the thought.","First things first! Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing theres sexual attraction. And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target. Careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill your marriages void with another person. Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection. Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendshiplike that.Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns. Ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them. Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day. Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.Cmo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?Mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los das, la amo con todo mi corazn, pero no siento la intimidad como antes. Ya no tenemos sexo, lo cual me molesta tremendamente. Me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo, lo cual no ayuda. Nada pasara, pero hay pensamientos al respecto.Primero lo primero! Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero tambin pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atraccin sexual. Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto ms grande. Ten cuidado con esa amistad! No quieres llenar el vaco que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona. Aunque no ests teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexin especial, compartiendo intereses en comn y actividades que los unen ms aun. Pregntate como te sentiras si tu esposa tuviera una amistad as.Intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio. Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupacin y como te sientes con el distanciamiento. Pregntale que le gustara hacer para reconectarse, sugirele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas. Hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes, hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos, y comunicarse durante el da, aunque sea con textos. Recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversin."
"My boyfriend of eight years and father of our two children is a truck driver. He is never home and only contributes to our family financially. There is no other support given. He comes home when able, sleeps, gives money, and leaves again. I cant get him to do anything with me or the kids. He just sleeps and works.","After eight years and two childrens, people change. I suggest to talk to him about how you feel, let him know that although he is gone for a long time, his presence as a husband and father are required and important. Ask him if he will be willing to engage again and how he would like to do so. Many times when the dads are away, moms design a perfect routine and they feel like they will disturb it. Make alone time and family time for him, so you can reconnect as a couple and then as a family.Cmo trabajo con un esposo que solo contribuye econmicamente?Mi novio de ocho amos y padre de mis dos hijos es camionero. El nunca est en casa y solo contribuye financieramente. No provee apoyo en ninguna otra forma. El viene a casa cuando puede, duerme, provee dinero y se va otra vez. No puedo lograr que haga nada conmigo y los nios. Solo duerme y trabaja.Despus de ocho aos y dos hijos las personas cambian. Te sugiero que hables con tu pareja sobre cmo te dientes, djale saber que aunque el esta fuera la mayora del tiempo, su presencia como pareja y padre es requerida e importante. Pregntale si el est dispuesto a comprometerse ser parte activa de la familia y como lo hara. Muchas veces cuando los paps estn afuera las mams desarrollan rutinas que luego ellos no quieren interrumpir. Crea tiempo a solas para dedicarle a el para que puedan reconectar como pareja y luego como familia."
"My boyfriend and I have been going out for about a year. I suddenly find myself jealous when I see him talking to other girls. I have never been this way before. I dont like these feelings. He said that my jealousy would cause our relationship to have problems. I told him I cant help these feelings. I dont know where they are coming from, but this is how I feel, I tried to stop, but I cant. I really like this guy, but Im afraid that Im messing up the relationship. Its just stupid.","Trust is at the top of what makes a healthy relationship. It sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend. This is not stupid, this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through. Sometimes we need to talk to someone like a counselor who is disconnected from our life to understand our feelings and what they mean in our relationships."
Weve been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. Youre only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he cant accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions youve made, theres already a level of discomfort here that shouldnt be ignored. No, he doesnt have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesnt dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way."
"My husband and I are in our 40s. Weve been married 17 years. Three weeks ago, he said he loves me but is not in love with me. He was going to leave me, but he said he thought about it and decided to stay. I dont know how to feel any more. How should I take what he said and not feel so hurt? He has been very blunt, and hurtful words just come out of his mouth. He makes me feel like Im nothing, but I so dearly love him with everything in me. He said it wasnt a midlife crisis.","I get it. Your husband tells you that hes not in love with you, but oops, hes changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer? Excuse me? My Dear, its okay if you expect more than that from a marriage. Maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage. You say you love this man, who makes you feel like nothing. I say it might be time to sit down with an individual therapist and look objectively at your marriage and whether its working for you."
"There are intimate things she did early in the relationship, and things she had once agreed to try that she will not do now. I end up thinking about it all day. I feel rejected and think I married the wrong person.","Id say youre letting fear get a hold on you! You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasnt initiated in a long while, but its a big leap to go from that to I married the wrong person. Fear is telling you that she doesnt respect or like or want you? Look at the bigger picture. What is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?...that she is the right woman for you?...that she loves you?...that she cares about whats important to you? If there is evidence there, then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughts.Talking to your wife is so important right now. We all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enough...but they cant read our minds! Can you lovingly let her know what you miss? ...what you hope for?...what you need? This is the meat of a loving relationship. Sharing who we are, so that we can love each other better.Your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that shell listen to what you long for. Can you risk feeling vulnerable? You cant control her answer, but can you trust her to care?"
"We dont have sex a lot. I cheat when we argue. I dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them. Its a one time thing, and I never see them twice.","Hello, and thank you for your question. The question aboutwhether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answeredby you. However, here are a few things to consider and questions to askyourself to help you find your answer1.Do you feel like you are violating your ownvalues or morals? This is important, because we all have different values andmorals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamousrelationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feellike you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are nothappy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, thenperhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is stillright for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and thatis alright. Finally,if you value your husbands feelings and know that theaffairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to yourown values. That can only be determined by you. 2.Based on how you describe your relationship, itsounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside, it looks like the affairsare a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument. Thisis something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in arelationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring abouthow our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps thequestion to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband,is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex,argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. 3.What are your goals for this relationship? If westart to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things onautopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. Noneof which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes anddreams you once had for this relationship?4.Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Nothaving affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leadingyou to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some helpto get it fixed. Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come tosome kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. I certainlywish you well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks Im not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I dont want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","These fears are completely normal. Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. That can help...to remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.You mention a partner, but Im not sure if you currently have one. Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When youre really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish.How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence.In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you good in bed. But be patient with yourself. Your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready. Theres not rush."
"I am married, but I had sex with my friend. I feel guilty, but I feel not guilty too. Do I need to feel guilty? Its my body, and I have full rights to do what I like.","I dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel. Some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat, and others not at all. It could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions. When something we do is hidden...a secret...its easier to avoid feeling guilty. I wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions. But lets put that question aside for now. There are better questions.What do you want? Do you want your marriage? If not, this may be why you dont feel guilty.Do you want to be able to sleep with your friend? Its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair. Yes, you get to do whatever you want with your body...and...there may be consequences. Affairs almost always get discovered.Who do you want to be? What kind of partner do you want to be? What might your partner feel if they knew? How might you feel then? Would you care? Has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partner?I suggest that these other questions might be a place to start. Exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe. I wish you the best as you sort it out."
"As I was growing up, my mother and father always fought. With that, I grew trust issues. I think its going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then I want to. I try not to let it affect me, but I cant.","If you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship. Dont allow their problems to become your problem. You didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them. Like in the court of law, if no evidence....find not guilty.Dont make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior."
"We had our first kid 15 years ago, and sex has been nonexistent ever since. It only happens every three or four months. We have been to counseling, and I have been told over and over again she will come around. She hasnt, and Im intimately lonely! I think its time to move on, but how do I do that without hurting my kids?","Hi Pocahontas, This is a painful situation. When youre in a relationship, you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection. When it dries up, its a very lonely place. Its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship. Its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues, pain issues, sexual dysfunction or is asexual.There is no one answer here. Only you can decide what is right for you. But let me ask some questions to help you explore next stepsAside from the sex, is your wife loving and supportive? What are the other ways in which you feel loved? Does your wife talk to you? Does she communicate her needs and desires? Does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex? If your wife is generally a loving, open partner, you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal. Whether she resolves this or not, it can help you to cope with the rejection. This is your wifes issue, and the ball is in her court.In my opinion, if couples therapy hasnt helped, its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist. Let her be in charge of the sex for a while, to take the pressure off, and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship. If you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out, it can help you manage your own emotions.Pressure to have sex might push her further away. Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship? Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship? One good way to make sure you get is to give and I mean give what she wants, not sex.Its appropriate to say to her now I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy. I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually. If this is all you want, Im not sure I can do it. If you want us to be more sexual, I need you to address what gets in the way for you. Give her some time, help her in any way you can, and then see where you are. See if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers.Then...you have a decision to make. I encourage you to make it looking at the big picture, not just the sex."
"I have been dating a guy for two years. I think I love him, but I dont know any more. I am in my late teens, and I have been living with him for most of our relationship. I have been talking to a guy friend, and I feel more loved by him than my boyfriend.","Hi Michigan, Relationships are so sparkly for a few years, and then things start to feel different. Most of the time, this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning. We stop talking a lot, because we have less to discover...we do less for each other and buy fewer gifts...spend less time together...all because we have already formed the love and attachment and we dont need to fill the gas tank as much. So, just because it feels different doesnt mean its gone bad.Having said that, it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you dont feel loved enough right now. Can you tell him? Have you told him? The strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are. Let him know what you need, and see if he gets it.You have choices to make and there is no wrong choice. You certainly have the right to say this isnt feeling great anymore, or I want to explore other relationships, and walk away. But often its worth it to see how good something can be before you bail.Youre drawn to someone else, and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship. Your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new. Your boyfriend cant compete with that if he doesnt know youre unhappy.For some people, being drawn to someone else is a sign theyre not into their partner. For others, its a danger alert, and it makes them want to improve their current relationship. Which one are you?"
"He owns his own business. Sometimes, he stays out all night but doesnt tell me. We have a son together, and I get to stay home with him. He says I complain too much about what hes doing. Weve been together a year and a half. I got pregnant after being together for a month. We moved in together when I had my son in July. Everything was great, and then he started the staying out. He then started not spending time with either of us. I just dont know if Im doing something wrong. Weve talked and he says this is just how he is, but he wasnt like this before.","Congrats on the birth of your son!Your situation sounds painful, lonely, and isolating.And, these features are eating away at your selfconfidence.Start by believing in yourself. The feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least, partly true.Ask your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view. If he does, then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a family.If these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your sons life, then youll need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son, by yourself.I send you lots of good luck!"
"I love him so much, and I dont know what to do.",Does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love him?Ask him this so you will clearly know his definition of love.
"My fianc and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately its changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league, but he has no time for me. We live two hours from family, and when I leave home to see family, hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone. But when were together, everything is okay. No fighting or anything. I love this man, but I just dont know what to do anymore.","Hello, It doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you, especially if your feelings have not changed. It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there. There may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you.Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, maycause some relief. Wheninitiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember.Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoidusing extreme, black and white language i.e. always and never.For example, you may say something such as, I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and Im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus You are never intimate with me anymore.Dont be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows formore clarity and deeperexplanation. Lastly,ask yourself and possibly him what part you play in the recent changes. Does he feel that youve been distant? Does he need something from you? Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit. Having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.Best of luck to you!"
"I have been married for ten years. My husband is 29 years my senior. We have a young daughter. Ever since she was born, my husband has shut down. We have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me. Ive told him how I feel for years, and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy, but I still have to literally beg for sex and affection. My selfesteem is gone, and I feel so alone. He has stranded me. He uses his passiveaggressive ways and ignores every comment I make. He refuses to talk to me in detail.","Hi Smyrna,Your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem. I understand how lonely you must feel, not only sexually, but emotionally too.From what you describe, it seems that he wants tobe there for you, but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue. My hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you. But I think he does have something to say.Your husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten years...that puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty? Has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age? Its possible that your husband is bewildered, angry, grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection, and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this. He may feel like hes letting you down, and hes scared it will get worse, so hes sticking his head in the sand. Of course, that doesnt help, does it?The worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless, that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame. Eventually, you stop chasing him, and you drift further apart.Its a bit of a conundrum...how to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities. Maybe lower your expectations for a bit? Your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears, and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared, and that hes not rejecting you...just protecting himself.I would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like Sweetheart, we both know that somethings not right here. I think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better, but can we agree that its not? I need you to either talk to me about whats happening, or please go see a doctor. What I need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us. Either of those things would show me that.In the end, you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way. If he does neither, then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage.I wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help? Just a thought."
"My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. Weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I dont know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","Hi Michigan,This is a common issue. How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? I totally get that its hard, and I believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places.I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help you.Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file because after all, his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions, dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure, treat you as though youre a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places although people arent always good with those why questions!You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least youve decided to give him that chance, and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Dont go snooping, dont interrogate him. Its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.This is a start for you. A good therapist can be helpful too!"
"Im in love with my friend who is also a girl. I fell in love with her in a few months. That was my first love. We used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on Facebook. I thought she had the same feelings for me, but I was wrong. I always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life. But all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy. Ive tried to be in relationship with guys, but I cant be in love with them.","It all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is. You may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling, or the feelings may be real. This is something you will find out for yourself, however, it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person. Time will tell, but if you need to discuss this, you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a LGBT group with meetings and discuss this with them. I hope this is helpful."
Ive been getting told lately by my partner that its embarrassing that Im so antisocial around his family and friends. I believe its because Im not as social as him.,"Hi Buffalo, I think youre right your partners reactions are about him. I have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you love...that youre embarrassed by them. The subtext says Youre not good enough, and I love that you can reject that false message.You dont have to be different for anyone. If he cant accept you for who you are, what is he doing with you? Your social habits unless they are extreme...like you refuse to go anywhere arent a reflection on him its just you being you. Also, and Im sure youve found this...the more he judges you, the more difficult it is for you to be the confident, outgoing person he wants you to be...so his method of trying to change you doesnt even work!I think thats the crux...hes trying to change you. What does that make you want to do?"
How can I know if Im just being paranoid?,"Hi Texas,Oh, thats a powerful idea, isnt it? It burrows into your head. Lets figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If its a yes, then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that youre hiding something. I need openness. If they havent cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing thats triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because were not interesting. This may be true if what you wrote down is They didnt really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. Im just scared and suspicious. Thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened. I can trust.If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or youre having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheating...its evidence of something. Ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. Id say when there is some evidence, its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense, then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you.I hope that helps."
"My partner and I have had an amazing relationship and connection for over two years. Were very committed to each other and are planning a very long life together. However, he recently was very open and honest that he isnt interested in having sex with me anymore. He says this has happened in every past relationships and has ended it as a result. He knows its because its the same person feeling, but how can he get over this?","I wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriend.Since you both are planning a long life together, instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex, he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committed.What are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationship?Knowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like."
"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesnt have the desire. Shes also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears Ill cheat on her. She doesnt know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didnt know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ehh and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. Were married and we have a baby on the way.",That sounds really challenging for both of you. Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isnt as arousing as is possible. There are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships.
"We got into arguments, and we would break if off but start it back up again. We clicked, or so I thought. We are both married with problems in our marriage. We never have sex we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together. His wife found out, and he lied to her and didnt even refer to it as an affair. I cant stop thinking about him. We just click. Ive been married for 16 years, and Ive never liked anyone other than my husband. Now I like him, and well never be together.","If you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved. There is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage. Maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible, then maybe you want something else for your life. If you and your husband are willing, I would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together.

"My boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me, and I believe it. It has been one of the best relationships I have been in for a short period of time, but he has lied to me so much. Hell tell me that hell stop lying, and while hes saying that, hes hiding something or lying about something. First, it was about a girl. He hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in. Next was his exgirlfriend. He put a fake contact name, and it was just friendly, but he lied to my face. All the time, he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better.","New York, New York...its not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself. Verbal expressions are easy, but its walking the walk thats more important in the end. When someone shows you what theyre capable of, you can believe them. Hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful, and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lying.What youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence. He might love you with his heart, but love, in the end, is a verb and is based on respectful, loving behaviours.My wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve."
"I was texting a guy who wasnt my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out. We work together, so he went to work and told everyone I was cheating on him. I moved out of the house. There have been previous problems, and I feel like Im usually the issue here. In order for us to move on, he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesnt want me to do anymore. Im wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if I should walk away.","Hi Dallas,While I think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that, your situation sounds onesided and rigid. Will you have a list too? There are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers, saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forward...does he decide when you move in and out? Your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship. Do you have a voice? If you are uncomfortable with the contract, are you listening to your own voice? If you cant hear your own voice, maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and want.No relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy? Relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do. They dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor. You have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now, except clarity, and his control may be what is making things muddy for you. Youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly. A therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is."
"About a month ago, I went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me. He gave her a promise ring when they were together, and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room. I found many things on his phone, but that broke my heart the most. He deleted all the messages but two. I cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that. It really kills me, and I cant stop thinking about it.","Your sense of hurt is very understandable.Do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phones?I ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship.Probably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other, youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the other.With this new level of clarity, his past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful .Once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple, who he was as a past partner to someone else, will matter very little."
"I have been married for 20 years. He and I both cheated. I hid my cheating for 14 years. Over that time, I let life stress me out. I became depressed. When I finally woke up, he felt I had pushed him out.","Do you both want to fix the marriage?The relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too, will have one person who does all the changing.This dynamic itself creates problems of its own.About your husband telling you he feels pushed out, did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like this?All you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt like.If he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do, anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you, is ok.Because affairs create mistrust between two people, the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trust.Talking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other, how you each are feeling, what matters to you, is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future."
"My boyfriend recently got a kitty. I hate cats in general, and he knows it. It grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat. I want to throw out the cat. I feel very jealous.","Sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense position.What was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with you?If you dont already know his answer, then find out. Doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you. Does he expect you to accept without question, whatever he does? Does he care about your views? Does a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you so?Please dont be mean to the cat. Its not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends care.There are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriend.Who knows, your boyfriend may come back home with three more cats!Start with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings."
"Over the course of a few days, my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues. After she thought things through, she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me. She instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family. At that point, she said our marriage was over. Now over the course of the last few days, she has taken a friendship from a coworker. She insists there is nothing more than friends, but she has spent all her free time with him.","Hi Portland,This must feel like your world is turned upside down, for your wife to declare her confusion, followed closely by resignation, followed closely by a new friend. I get how upsetting this is.If I was your therapist, Id want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. Be careful not to jump to conclusions.Sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time, and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage. She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so.Its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...shes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. Only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist, but its not your place to tell her to do this.Or, its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her. Right now, its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate, if shes asking for that. We cant trap people in a marriage. If she needs separation, or distance, then its respectful to give her that.That doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want whether its to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time.I cant predict what will happen here. But you can find out what the best path for you is. I wish you the best."
"I have no idea what happened. I go places and do things but still feel lonely. I honestly have no friends, and I am always the one texting people and bothering people. I feel invisible, like someone that no one wants to be around.","A lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situations.Is it possible that at this time period in your life, being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your life?If yes, then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time, even though to some degree being alone is not your first choice.At the very least, since you arent happy with being the one who texts others, then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you first.Also, most relationships are not forever. Is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity?"
"I love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex, but when it comes to the actual penetration, I hate it. I dont know why, but I just want it to be over. I feel like crying. I dont know why I dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it.","Although I am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area, an initial question I have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing.? If you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over. I would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on. I encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations, if any, about being sexually active. Do you fear pregnancy? Are there problems in the relationship? Are you afraid of the emotional intimacy?Another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way. When these types of traumatic events occur, people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma. Such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with. If this is the case I strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues.A final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration. If so, I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems. Although pain can also be associated with emotional issues, it is always good to rule out possible physical causes. I hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction. Take care."
I didnt trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling. I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on. Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust.,"Hello. Being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled. Has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her? If so, then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back. Couples counseling would be of benefit. If not, then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from. There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them, the issue is not likely to get resolved. In the meantime, I suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes, think before you speak. Ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her. Instead of arguing, try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship. Hope it all works out for you both!"
"Ive been in a relationship for over a year. Hes cheated and lied. I heard hes married, but he says hes not. Everything is very up and down theres no trust. Recently, he went on a trip, and I promised him Id behave and not drink because when I drink, I drink too much, and I tend to make poor choices. This time, I made a huge mistake I drank too much, and I cheated on him. I slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what I was doing is wrong. I told him and he just got really rude. He called me names and threatened me. I feel bad as I do love him. We just have so many issues. Im not a bad person, Ive just made a lot of bad mistakes. Its unintentional, and I know right from wrong, but why do I still make the wrong choice?","Hi Calgary Canada!, Let me get this straight...youre in a relationship, but he might be married. You both cheat and lie and hes abusive. The short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it. Relationships dont heal us and they dont help us grow up. We have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before its going to work. Id recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while. You have a lot to sort out. I wish you the best."
"I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.","Hi Hampton,Although Id bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship, it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now. I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you.This is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs. If you both want the relationship to improve, a couples therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea its a complex picture that youve only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime, you can try a few things have compassion for your wife. Shes in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too, right? Help her to see that youre not just angry, but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close, intimate, and sexual that dont involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you wont pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wifes wishes and ideas are. You might be surprised.These things take time to address, especially if theyve been years in the making. I do recommend seeing that therapist. Relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change. Best of luck."
"Ive been with my husband for eight years now. We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away. He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family, she cant help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didnt want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. Hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because Im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life. Im of course hurt and in shock. I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart. I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought.","Hi Jayuya, Im struggling in this moment with my own biases. I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect. Your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same. He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours. And now, in an attempt to manipulate and silence you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him? There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you, are there?So, my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that, and I dont think either of those things will help you. Id like to ask you some questions though...Are you happy? Do you know what happy is? Do you know what respect is? Are your children safe? Are your children witnessing violence because if they are, then theyre not safe? Do you have supports? Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life? Have you ever been to a womens shelter? Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly? Thats what I suggest. These are big decisions, you deserve some support. I wish you the best."
"I just got married with my husband. I have four kids of my own, and he accepts me with my kids. I am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his. Now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past. I know all marriages have problems, but sometimes I feel its not going to work out if theres no trust. Its hard for me to let go because I love him, but I am getting tired.","Hi Louisiana,You say that the problems are with your past, but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past?. You dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationship.Trust is the first stage in a relationship. Moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make, and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element. But you didnt see this coming, did you? Thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface.I give you credit for wanting it to work, and I believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust. Good luck!"
"My boyfriend and I have not had sex in a couple of weeks. He had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. I have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. Im scared to touch him and get close to him because Im afraid that I will hurt him.","Are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex again?Being able to talk together about topics that involve both of you, will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional level.Also, there are many ways of making love. If your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed, then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions, is to read about these together with him.I hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another, while developing more emotional closeness in the process."
"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isnt. I have full access to his phone, social media, and emails. I never find anything, but Im obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? Its driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that youre owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some dont, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently more trusting, in your case, you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they dont reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats, or youre not enough for him. Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be much...perhaps none, and what is the evidence that doesnt support it I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity.... Youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. Thats the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe it.Its possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!"
"My husband always works. He does work from home, but his hours are from morning until night, and he neglects his family. If I have anything I want to do, I have to find a babysitter, but he does what he wants. He rarely comes to bed when I do, and we never have date nights.","Hi Ohio, The crazy things about situations like this is that, almost guaranteed, while your husband is out working and away from home, he feels hes doing it all for you and the kids he believes hes loving you. He might feel like hes carrying his family on his shoulders. Your love language is different...youd rather spend time with him or talk to him...you want to feel like hes a bigger part of the family and feel connected to him. I absolutely understand that, and I support you asking for that.He might very well miss that feeling of connectedness too, but hes likely also feeling the weight of financial responsibility. A lot of men and women dont talk about this but they feel it. Sometimes they feel like they cant win either way theres pressure to earn and pressure to be home.He has needs too he probably wants more appreciation and less blame.I urge you to talk to him about how you feel, find out how hes feeling, and use a professional to assist you if your communication styles arent great. Right now you WANT to spend time with him and that tells me that you have a good chance of addressing this problem successfully."
How do I stop those thoughts?,"The thoughts you are having are just thoughts. Not actions. It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts. If you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great. If you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts,you may want to see a cognitivebehavioural therapist. Take care."
Im a 40 year old male and having erection problems. Still have the desire for a woman. Awfully frustrated. Any suggestions? My Doc doesnt want to discuss it.,When a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one! ED can often be caused by health issues. If all physical possibilities are ruled out then its time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist. Heres a good article for you to start with.
"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. Weve had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. Shes on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm Ive ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.","You are newly married, you Have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. What if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. You know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating. It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay. Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection, I wrote a post about this a while back, you can find it here And have fun with it!"
We make love once per month. Is it normal?,"To begin with, whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next, every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind. Your sexual lives will ebb and flow. What Id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having. Id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection, I wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here."
"When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long. Been married 3 years, together 14. What do you think?","Sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff. Its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be. It sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together, thats both common and confusing! Intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow. Resparking your passion will involve growing. Using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires. Marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required."
I have this weird fetish that Im afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is. I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though.The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not. If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings. You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of. You may find other people have the same interest as you. Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them. Dont hold back with your therapist. Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are. There is no need to suffer with this alone."
My boyfriend cant get over my promiscuous past. He says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. He says he should have had more sex with different people. I dont know how to handle this.,"I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles.One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STDs before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly dont want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just dont want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though.If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment. I dont see that you have done anything wrong. If you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be. In time, the right person for you will enter your life."
"I have no sex drive due to medical issues. Ive shut down completely and closed everyone out. Ive even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since thats what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned hes seeing someone else. Ive since told him that I wanted to work things out but hes not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back is because Im jealous. How do I show him Im serious?","Im sorry to hear about your current situation. My heart goes out to you during this time.First of all, it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband, you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing. More than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.Secondly, you must be upfront and honest with your husband. Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling. I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him.If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship, he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship.The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof, was not your fault.Best of luck to you and your husband!"
"I just lost my grandpa and im having a rough time with it. I need some help to deal with the loss, but I dont think I can pay for counseling. Where Can I get help?","If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged. If you feel like things, situations, your outlook are shifting for you."
My grandma and brother both passed away 11 years ago and sometimes at night I just cant stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but wont have ever again. I cant sleep at night when the memories and tears come Ill be fine all day then at night...boom! its like waterfalls from my eyes. Why cant I stop crying?,"Its good to know you are reminiscing about good memories. The sadness and crying is normal when you are missing a loved one. You are noticing that grief changes, it doesnt just stop. You have recognized that there will be moments in life that you will want to have shared with your brother and grandma and it just seems unfair that you cannot. I often find that when someone is stuck in the place you are, it is a result of unfinished business and in your case, it appears, unfinished futures. A professional versed in grieving and its intricacies, can guide you to navigate through this and lessen the intensity that you experience. As life goes on, there will be many moments that you will have wished they were present, but those moments do not have to bring you such intense emotion. Seek some help, you wont regret it."
"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I dont have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","I am so sorry about your loss. Losing someone you love is always difficult, however, losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life. What makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister. It is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided, but what I suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you. It is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way. By her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion. Only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother. If there is truth to this, then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor. There could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence, but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will. You and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle. When two people are grieving the same loss at the same time, it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle, even if they both were on good terms with each other. Depression is part of the cycle of grief. It is absolutely normal to feel sad, as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms i.e., feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, low energy, sleep or appetite changes, etc.. Anger is another phase of the grief cycle. Your sister may be stuck in the anger phase, not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness, so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you, in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grief.Finally, it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated. Were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss? Depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder. Depression can be situational i.e., triggered by an event or related to genetics, undiagnosed health issues, stress, trauma or other potential risk factors. If you have a family history of depression, you are more susceptible to have depression. It would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider, and if necessary, get treatment through counseling and medical interventions."
The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about whats gone feels so amazing almost like Im high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories and a close friend that left me are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?,Do some selfreflecting as to what areas of your life youd currently like to develop.The good news is you know how happiness feels.That you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life.
"I spent my whole life taking care of my dad, but left because of his verbally abusive behavior. I was the only one that helped with his health issues. I feel if I hadnt left he might still be alive. I need help dealing with my grief and guilty conscience.","I see such a sharp contrast between your question and your first sentence. Do you see it? I feel guilty about my fathers death, and I spent my WHOLE LIFE taking care of my dad. Wow. After everyone else had left him to his misery, you hung in there. He is so lucky to have had you there. You didnt have to do that.I have a hunch that your dad blamed you for a lot of things. Abusive people do that a lot they make you believe things are your fault when theyre not. You did the opposite of what you fear you did. You didnt contribute to your dads death your selfless care gave him a longer life...better health. In the end, no ones love and care could save him.No one could fault you for deciding you had had enough at some point. I would never expect anyone to keep putting themselves in a hurting place over and over again. But this is what you did. You did it for him, and you did it so you wouldnt feel guilty. But you feel guilty anyway, right?...so putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt. Can you tell yourself Its okay that I had to take care of myself too.... I gave up a lot for my dad I have nothing to feel guilty about.Putting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do. And... my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel good enough in this world, and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself."
"My wife is trying to leave. She agreed to come back and give me a little time. Even said she hopes I can do it. We buried our first born in Jan 13 years ago. She never got past it. So every year around this time, she gets emotional and says she doesnt think she loves me, but then we go back to normal. This time, another guy came in and showed her attention. Ill forgive the cheating if shell come home.","Im sorry that you lost your first born child. Death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their lives.The good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying way.There are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parents.If what you write here are your observations and theories about your wifes outlook and conclusions, then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write here.What needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriage.Often, a crisis such as a childs death, motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships. Keep in mind that looking deeply doesnt necessarily mean leaving the marriage.Also, be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent. Be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertainties.There is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner. Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partner.The conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments, hold a lot of emotion. They are difficult to keep on track.Best recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals, and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship."
I loved him more than anything. He passed away on our anniversary which was also the day I was going to apply for our apartment. Im not handling it well. I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.,"I am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing. Grief is something that can take a long time to recover from. Have you considered speaking with a grief counselor? Being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial.Do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly. This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward.In the mean time, immerse yourself with positivity i.e. Good friends, hobbies, exercise and try to schedule a time with a counselor.Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join. Oftentimes, it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as you.Good luck to you. I hope you will find peace and comfort soon."
What can I do to stop grieving my mothers death? When I am awake I just cry every day. I dont have anyone to talk to. I need help I am still cry over her. Will I ever stop crying? Its been 3 years.,"I am sorry that you lost your mother. That is a really hard thing for someone to go through.There is really no set time for grief to be over, but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job, but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help. For one thing, bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages.At first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining, in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever.Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable, and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings, dont try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long. I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief."
"Im a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and Ive become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I dont understand why Im feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?","Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic. You might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.I dont have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like its begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback Im writing here is very general and doesnt address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. One of the ways to think about substance misuse is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what youre avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, thats your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you dont drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness."
"Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.","More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question, such as your age, whether you live with your dad or not, and what other family members live in the household.Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you cant make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him.Research codependency. Theres a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Dont loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Dont call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his drivers license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesnt stop.What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they dont then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you dont live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in.You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to, but are for the family members. They can help you."
"Im planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking but its hard. Sometimes its not a physical need, its mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself. Thats a great first step! Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if youre consciously trying to quit, youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually Ill give in and eat it.Youre going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. Thats normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. Thats what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now., but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.Ive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit your baby!"
"My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since weve split, Ive heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?","Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain, there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well. I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns. Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals. Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships."
"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didnt have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.",Your friend needs to admit they have a problem. If not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more. It is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested. In other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them. Like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways. I would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation. Encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her.
Shes my stepmom. Im pretty sure shes illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad.,I would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom. Usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed. Be aware of behavior changes and mood swings. Be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help.
"My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and hes now in his mid30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. Hes sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toetotoe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my moms face. I feel terrible, but hes always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, hes single, and shes only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. They do nothing to try and help.",I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation. It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted. It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself. Other individuals need to take the same accountability. Enabling often happens in households with addiction. It can be a challenging environment to live in.
My brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. Hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather. I was adopted in by his dad who just passed and his mother will not Get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility. Do I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?,"Im sorry to hear that your brother has been having such a rough time. Hes lucky to have you on his side although he may not always see it that way.As far as whether you can sign him in, that depends on a lot of different things.I would suggest that you Google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to crisis hotline. They can tell you how it works in that county. My guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment, but I cant be entirely sure.You could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility. I have not heard of that being a problem, but I guess it would depend on insurance.If you have trouble finding a local hotline, consider calling the national crisis number 8002738255 and ask them to help you find someone local."
"I have bipolar II disorder, Im addicted to alcohol and weed, and Im hopeless. I keep drinking even though its harming myself and others.","What an important question. Im hearing your hopelessness and fear about the damage of your substance use and it sounds like you have reason for concern. While there can be negative stigma about using substances, for the most part substance use is an attempt to cope with emotional distress in the absence of sufficient coping strategies. We all look for comfort when we are in pain and this may be the way that you are getting comfort even though it is also hurting you. In order to stop using alcohol and weed you will need a lot of support and you will need to learn other ways of getting comfort when you are in pain or struggling with bipolar related symptoms.There is nothing to be ashamed of and we all need help when we are struggling. I would encourage you to reach out for support in any way that you can.Have you talked with your health care providers about your concerns or friends or family members?Here are some links of resources in Whistler that may be helpful"
"My new daughterinlaw just informed me that she is smoking marijuana while pregnant because of her morning sickness. Im in shock and I dont know how to respond. I just lost my mom, and she was good with advice.","Have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these, regarding the topic? When you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions, then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinions.Plan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in law.Since your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child, he may also be interested in being part of this conversation.Also, during your discussion, find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in law.It is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels better.Maybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky way.Sending Good luck!"
"My mother has Alzheimers and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isnt her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see ones parents age and to cope with the new demands. Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated. Im guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are nonimportant to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt. Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes. Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimers. Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase. Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax. Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate selfcare. Finally, look for an Alzheimers support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing. You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, MirellaImage and Likeness Counseling"
"My mother has Alzheimers and I can see that she has lost some of her intellectual abilities. Even though I know this disease is not her fault, Im still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems","Good observation on your part, to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward you.Has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you?If prior to the onset of Alzheimers, she never examined her way of relating to you, and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you, then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue.She may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because shes been stuck in this attitude for most of your life.The good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom, has very little to do with the way she relates to you.This is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimers began.You can however, feel a little more free knowing that youre not deserving of being ignored."
"I have a mother who is still running my life even though Im almost 30 years old. I want to move out and live my own life, but it feels like as long as I do what my mom wants our relationship is okay. Its never okay if I dont do what she wants. I dont know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about whether its right in her eyes. Would it help for me to talk to someone about this?","If the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels okay is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life, then this only seems ok.In fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done, does not have their own ability to think for themselves.Separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters, from your mothers point of view, may be difficult.First, realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself.Youll need practice until you feel comfortable.Unless, if youve been thinking through decisions youd like to make and the idea of your mothers anger is the only point which stopped you, then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life.Basically, it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best. Be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest."
"I have known her for years. She was dating my brotherinlaw when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. Shes like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","Hi Lincoln,It can be very difficult for children who have lost a parent to then see their other parent moving forward with anyone, so I understand how this change is even more upsetting to you.And...your father and your friend have clearly established a friendship and fallen in love. Did you see this coming? I hope they didnt hide it from you. If they did, maybe this is the issue? It would be a legitimate one.But in the end, your father, and your friend, are adults who are free to fall in love with whomever they wish and hopefully they can count on the support of people who trust and love them. Could there be blessings here you havent seen yet? It seems you love this person who is like a sister could it be a good thing that her place in your life is more permanent?Ask yourself these questions... What is the worst part of this? What do I fear losing? What do I fear at all? What is the evidence that this will happen? The answers might surprise you.Your children will follow your lead. If you are supportive of their grandfather, they will follow suit.Hopefully you can grieve the change, know that your mother would likely want both of them to be happy, and embrace the blessings that come with having this woman close to you in a new way. I wish you the best."
"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I dont want to hear it anymore.","It is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being abandoned.Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself.It is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. Its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance. When empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again, I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........explain what you could do to help.www.PsychologyResource.ca"
"After I told them, they yelled at me.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. I truly wish Icould give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately I cant do that. Their acceptance of youis a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So, here are a few things I would suggestSurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That wont take the place of your familys acceptance, and I wont even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting upsome personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may, or they may not. And if they dont, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that.If you startseeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting withcounselor may be a great idea. I am bias probably, but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea. Hope this helps. Be well. Be you. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"Im an adult, facing problems with my mom. Shes way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesnt wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.","The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to you.It is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters.Each person, including you, has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone.Stick up for your own right to make decisions.If she doesnt accept your independent viewpoints, then this doesnt give away your right to have these views.Since she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you, then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about whats on your mind.If she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her, then feel free to make this choice."
"Im a teenage gay girl, and Im in love with a girl a few years older than me. She loves me too, but were not physically together at the moment. Ive been thinking about being transgender soon too, but my family doesnt accept me, so I honestly dont know what to do about that because I feel like I have to constantly hide the real me. It hurts so much to hide the real me. What can I do?","Many people do not accept the reality of gender beyond male and female.Obviously if your family doesnt accept your questioning status then this feels painful.All you really can do is continue your selfexamination and know youre in a nonsupportive family of doing so.To know the truth about your surroundings is much better than to not know, and also much better than pretending you are not in your current phase of gender expression questioning."
"My older brother in his 60s started dating a lady with Aspergers. She is hypersexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. Theyve been dating for a few months, and shes talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each others opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person youll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying whats necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then youll still know you tried your best to advise."
"Im a teenager, and I know the importance of my upcoming schooling. However, no matter how much I put in my best effort, my family thinks I have done zero effort in total. What can I do?","Your familys opinion is quite demoralizing.Unless you are lying to yourself or to them, then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family.The family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort.Maybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives. It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselves.Possibly too, the family people may have a twisted logic to their words, as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do more.If you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you, then definitely tell them.If not, then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others, and how disappointing this feels."
"She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong. For once, I want her to be proud of me. Its like no matter what I do, she does not have one nice word to say to me. She is always hateful towards me and always has been.","Im sad and heartbroken on your behalf.Im very sorry your mom has such negative views on you.Please know that there must be some reason in her personal history or relationship life which drives her to criticize you so strongly.The natural dynamic is for a mother to love and nurture her child.Unless at some earlier point in your relationship with her, you caused some massive harm to her which would justify her indirect dislike for you, then the best way for you is to find supportive and loving other people who will to some degree make up for the harshness you hear from her.Also, read online about others who have similar situations because there may be good guidance on keeping yourself emotionally safe from how she treats you."
"Im a teenager. My entire family needs family therapy, and more than likely individual therapy. My parents refuse to take action, and Im tired of it. Is there any way I can get out of this myself?","This sounds like a really tough situation. As a teenager, you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstances. If your parents are refusing toconsider counseling, you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adultabout finding some counseling resources even without your parents help."

My boyfriend and I have been arguing every night about the same thing. He also tells me that if I go visit my mother out of state he will be gone when I get back. He and my mother do not get along. What should I do?,"A relationship gets weaker, not stronger by threatening control of the other person.Start by telling your boyfriend to keep his remarks about you and the interests he is in which you two disagree, limited to these areas.Your relationship with your mother is between you and her.Regardless of how much he doesnt like her, to not respect your mother daughter relationship is unreasonable and disrespectful toward you.Threatening to take action against you by withdrawing himself from your relationship, is almost guaranteed to harm the good feelings between the two of you.Does you boyfriend dislike your mother for any reason having to do with her being a danger to you?Ask his reason since if he does this from concern for your emotional or physical safety, then this is good sentiment which is handled incorrectly, by a threat to you.What you should do is ask your boyfriend to not threaten you and to calmly talk about the topics you bring up here."
"I dont love my sister. I would never wish her harm, but if I could, I would wish for us not to be related. Is this cruel? Why must blood mean we have to be friends? Am I being unreasonable and is there a way to fix this? I do care about her, like I do every human being, but Id rather be with my friends than be with her at all. Its not just a teenager phase. I still love my mom and dad, and Im very close to them. However, its my sister I dont love or have ever really liked at all.","Not liking someone is not cruel even if it is a family member. There is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister. Some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well, other dont. We all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone even if they are related. In fact, sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each others flaws and imperfections. With that being said it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister. Sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect, and sometimes actually liking each other."
"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, theyve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy. However, its intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with."
For the past week or so me and my boyfriend have been fighting. He has been making a lot of bad choices and he is currently hospitalized. Im barely eating or sleeping because Im constantly worried about him. Everyone else in my life says that I should just forget about him and walk away. What should I do?,"Forgetting ones emotions is impossible.Since you are in a relationship with this guy, your emotions keep your feelings active toward him.Does he respect your upset with his lifestyle choices?Are the two of you having conversations about your opinions on him?Youre as entitled to dislike what he does as he is to like what he does.Since youre together in a relationship, respect for the others values and how best to live life, matters.He may be as unhappy about your dislike for his lifestyle as you are with his.Try to know whether hes willing to change to accommodate you.Study whether youre willing to change to accept his ways.See whether the two sides are close enough to be different from one another and still be happy together.Then, if the answer is no, you can consider to separate from him and your emotions gradually will recuperate from leaving the relationship."
Ever since my mother passed away my family has treated me like a stranger. Now Im concerned that my father will need to go into a nursing home. If that happens I think Im going to be on my own to handle it. What should I do? Im going to need my familys help and support.,"Understandably youd like support from those who know and love you.From what you write, your family members do not offer you your very reasonable expectation.Start by telling particular family members with whom you feel youd have the most likely chance of success in their meeting your expectation by loving you.This way you are able to tell yourself youve tried what is reasonable to try.Dont give up on expecting loving support for yourself!If your family members are unwilling to give you this, then start to give yourself loving attention and care.Gradually you will bring yourself in contact with new others who will love you.Loving yourself makes you attractive. so others will find your willingness to be loved."
"We just cannot seem to get along. I cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into World War 3. She treats me like I have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak. My real mother cares and tries to help me, but she cant do much, because my adoptive mother wont listen to her either.","Going to see a experience counselor would be my advice. You will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding. If she doesnt agree to counseling, really the only person you can change is you. I would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her, let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately. Hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way."
"We rent from from my boyfriends parents. His father drops by unannounced and stays for long periods of time. He lets himself into our home when we arent there on a daily basis and takes our dogs to his house. He picks up our mail. He has NO boundaries. Hes an opinionated, rude pushy person. He expects to spend every weekend around us, gives unsolicited advice on child rearing and does not respect our privacy at all. He barges in with no warning. He has a key and lets himself into our house without asking permission. I need help. How do I address this?","Youre expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriends father.Since the father is his, your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the father.If your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad, which is not what this sounds like, then great!If your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad, then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him, a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe here.If all else fails, then a new living space is always another possibility!"
I have been dating my exboyfriends cousin for a few years. We have gotten pretty serious. He wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex.,"Does your boyfriend agree with the other peoples opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesnt like hearing?Talk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering him.Once the two of you understand what, if any, the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status, youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow."
My dad doesnt like the fact that Im a boy. He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me Im extreme and over dramatic. I get so depressed because of my dads yelling. He keeps asking me why I cant just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis. Is this considered emotional abuse?,"Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.Theres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this. Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him."
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?","Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isnt it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. Thats a complex injury. I dont know whether youre still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity.Im curious about why youre just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how shes doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you cant, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while.So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like She doesnt regret the affair you dont know that, She doesnt deserve happiness that would be a harsh judgement, or She doesnt care that Im hurt again, theres no evidence of that. Where does your mind go? Its important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her.When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself What evidence supports that thought as truth? Its likely that either theres no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you cant know what shes feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesnt help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was okay. Its about saying It happened. I accept that I cant change it, and I dont want to carry the emotional burden around all the time. Forgiveness is putting it down. She... trust me this is true...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesnt affect her burden. It only adds to yours.Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? Youre hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life.If you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters."
"How do I ever trust another woman? I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet. I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions. Once the relationship was over, she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application.","Im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wife.On the positive side, think of how much you learned by going through this very painful time.Maybe you are naturally very generous and caring, to the point of expecting very little from the other person, for example.Consider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person. Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal, review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behavior.Theres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventures.Theres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again. The first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship. There is no designated time line. Youll simply feel more ready than you feel now.Very unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering from.Good luck!"
"I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad.","I admire your courage.If you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity, I would suggest a couple of things. There are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now. I dont mean to convey that everyone thinks, feels, or acts the same by any means, but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiences.I was trying to include some links for you, but that particular button isnt functioning window. If you search for transgender support on Google, youll find GLAAD and PFLAG, both of which are national organizations. This does not mean that you have to identify as transgender, but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.As far as telling your dad, if that is particularly concerning for you, I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support. This may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him.One thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation. That way, you have greater chances of having the persons attention andor not needing to end the conversation quickly.Also, please remember that you know yourself best, as each of us does."
"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. Shes always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. Im always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when shes not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesnt love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you when shes not angry?"
"My stepdad and I always mess around. Ive noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, its always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. Im a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.","Its hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe, I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way, it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are."
"Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, Im the one who steps in. Im the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people Im fighting for. Im only in my early 20s.","You could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting. A lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain. For other people, conflict is just hard to watch andor listen to.As for having a tough time trusting them, that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned. It can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you dont know when the next big fight or argument is going to start.The next time you step in for someone, consider asking yourself what is making you do that? What are you feeling in the moment?"
"She has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Im her caregiver. All she does is complain, hit me, call me names, and say things happened that didnt. When I tell her, she explodes. I didnt always hate her, but now every little thing she does irritates me, and I dont have the means to live on my own.","It sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating her.Something you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom. I dont know how old your mom is, but if she is younger, they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help. If you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out, this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together. Do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects you?From whom do you have support during all of this?"
"My mom and dad got divorced four years ago. I had to finish out the school year with my dad, and now they are deciding which place is best for me. I cant choose. How can I choose if I love both places?","I dont know how old you are, but depending on that, you may be able to talk with them about spending some time in both places. Even parents who live in different states can do that sometimes. Its not as frequent as spending one week at one house and the next week and the other, but I know that it happens.If you can talk with both of your parents about how you would like to live in both places, maybe you can all work out some kind of agreement."
"My dad is doing some really bad drugs, and Im not allowed to see him anymore because of what he can do to me or my siblings on this drug. It has affected me tremendously in my life. Its even caused me anger and stress.","It seems like you are going trough stages of grief, since the inability to see your father causes you similar feelings as if you had lost him. Perhaps you could send him letters expressing your feelings and hopes. But do understand that if he is under the influence of drugs he might not be able to empathize with your feelings or react in the way that he would have done so in the past. As the issue evolves find a therapist or counselor to help you work on letting go of that anger and stress, which may affect you negatively. Find forgiveness so you can have a relationship with him in the future.Qu puedo hacer con mi padre usuario de drogas?Mi papa est usando drogas muy malas, y no estoy autorizada a verlo por lo que me puede hacer a m y a mis hermanos. Esto afecta mi vida tremendamente. Me causa coraje estrs.Parece que estas pasando por estados de luto, ya que el no poder ver a tu padre causa sentimientos similares a cuando hay una perdida. Tal vez puedes escribirle cartas expresando tus sentimientos y esperanzas. Pero comprende que si el est bajo la influencia de drogas puede que no sienta empata o te responda como lo sola hacer. Mientras el problema se resuelve busca un consejero o terapeuta que te ayude a trabajar en resolver los sentimientos de coraje y estrs, trabaja tambin en perdonarlo para que puedas tener una relacin con l en el futuro."
"Im in my midtwenties now, and my boyfriend of seven years and I want to start a life. My mother is 100 codependent on me and is extremely manipulative. She suffers from type 1 diabetes, which she uses to guilt me if I ever leave her. The problem is that I will feel guilty.","Focus more on your own life and less on the very heavy descriptors you wrote to describe your mom.All the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to change.Since the only person who can change how your mom handles her life, is your mom, and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself, devote more energy and time to living your own life fully, despite the emotions you feel regarding her."
"My mother and I have an okay relationship. I know she loves me unconditionally, and I love her the same. However, more times than not, Im afraid to tell her anything personal because she either doesnt listen, she turns it around and makes everything about her, or she ignores things even when they are about my mental health.","How can I get my mother to listen to me without her freaking out?Communication with our loved ones can be tricky, but it is the key to maintaining a healthy and functional relationship with them. At times, it seems difficult to communicate with our family because many feelings and undercover messages are attached. Especially with our mothers, who often provide advice and feel responsible for us, it may feel like they are making everything about themselves as they express their worries and concerns.So what to do? First will be important to practice active listening skills, to ensure that you are receiving and understanding the message, without filtering it trough your own emotions or preconceptions of the person who speaks. Second, learn and practice assertive communication skills. Those will help you to communicate a message clearly and in pieces. It also emphasizes using Istatements to express how you feel at times when emotions become affected by the interaction. Third, you should practice, by writing your Istatement or role playing with your counselor. The trick with communication skills is that we need to practice them as often as possibleuntil you to master them. You can also contact a family therapist to improve those skills if it becomes challenging, or contact a mediator if more issues arise.Cmo puedo lograr que mi mam me escuche sin alarmarse tanto?La comunicacin con nuestros seres queridos puede ser dificultosa, pero es la clave para mantener relaciones saludables y funcionales con ellos. A veces, nos parece aun ms difcil comunicarnos con nuestra familia, porque hay muchos sentimientos y mensajes envueltos en la comunicacin. Especialmente nuestras madres, pueden hacer parecer que estn convirtiendo el asunto en algo personal, cuando se sienten preocupadas y responsables por nosotros y nuestras acciones.Y qu hacemos? Primero debemos aprender a escuchar activamente, para asegurarnos de que comprendemos el mensaje, y que no lo estemos filtrando a travs de nuestras emociones e ideas de la otra persona. Segundo, aprende y practica comunicacin asertiva. Esto te ayudara a comunicar un mensaje claramente y en pedazos. Tambin te ayudar a aprender expresiones del Yo, para identificar sentimientos afectados durante la interaccin. Tercero, es importante que practiques estas destrezas, ya sea escribiendo o con tu consejero. El secreto est en practicar las tcnicas de comunicacin cuantas veces sea posible, hasta que las uses espontneamente. Si tienes dificultad aprendiendo estas tcnicas, o el conflicto con tu mama es uno muy difcil de resolver, puedes contactar un consejero o mediador familiar para que te asista."
"It happens especially at me and my sister, and then she gets emotional and brings up the past. How should I deal with it? She is always stressed about her work and doesnt put her family first.","You are very wise for a young person. You have already figured out that other peoples behaviours...how they treat you...its not about you...its about them. I love that you dont blame yourself for your moms behaviours. Its not your fault. Shes getting upset because she doesnt know how to manage her emotions, and these emotions have to do with her past and her present stress. Youre just the trigger. Yes, this is normal, but its not necessary. She can find another way to manage her stuff.Unfortunately, you cant help your mom a whole lot or even help her recognize this. But for yourself... remembering that her behaviours are her issue is the biggest piece of dealing with it. You can always try some new strategies when you talk to mom...you can say Ill listen you better if you dont bring up past stuff, or Im worried about you mom. You seem stressed, or even I dont like the way you talk to me. Good luck!"
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I dont know if I am ready to come out to them.","Hello, and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularlydifficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are supposedto be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens sooften that there is actually a term for it bierasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny thatbisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefslike your parents seem to have. The unfortunate truth is that you can neverbe sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It soundspromising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it maysimply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurateinformation, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some morethings that you can considerand questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them1. If they dont respond the way you want them to, have you developed a supportsystem to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that allthe friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dontrespond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you AREokay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. 2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you canoffer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important forthem to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and youngpeople because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article fromGLAAD about bierasure 3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only takeplace when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media,and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they areready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, dontfeel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come outon your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understandthis. 4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Justbecause someone is LGBTQ doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be. Manypeople struggle with this. Havingyour own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you arein telling your parents. So, perhaps do some selfexploration about yourfeelings toward yourself. Sometimes people take friends with themwhen they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may wantto consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. Ifyour parents dont respond well, that doesnt mean that they never will. Somestart off upset, but then work their way through it. Best of luck to you. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"Im in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I dont know how to tell them because Im afraid theyll not want me anymore.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunatelyI cant do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only right way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both ofthese things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someones emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support thatyou need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how peoples parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a Coming Out party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that theirfeelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You dont have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though Im in my 20s. She argues with me over stupid stuff.,"This is a common issue. You grow up gradually, and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance. Im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom.Ultimately, you only have control over yourself, so thats the place to start. You can remind yourself that Moms behaviours dont mean that she doesnt trust you or love you its just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range. If you can see her responses as habits, rather than a reflection of how she feels about you, then you can keep yourself calm. The more calm you are, the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship.Take a look at the picture from her perspective. She may feel overwhelmed with finances are you in college?, and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesnt know how to recruit help for. I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you, cleaning, cooking, doing laundry...all those thankless mom tasks. Take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? Can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? Okay, so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. She wants help. You want respect. Lets talk about how you get both.I propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic. Mom...I see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen. Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want? Sell it as winwin. Then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.The first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships and hygiene.... Moms voice has no place in these arenas, unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard. This is a Mom says nothing about list.The second part is about what Mom needs from you. What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. Does she want you to contribute to rent? Buy your own food? Do your own laundry? What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom? How will these things be enforced? What will happen if you dont follow through? Write it all down so its really clear. It has to all be mutually agreed upon.The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you, and how you talk to her. You can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre 20 years old. Listen to what she wants too. Beyond the contract youve just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, its optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, youd be more willing to help out. AND, I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. Go for the winwin.I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom."
"I work two jobs and go to school for criminal justice. Over the summer, my father had a stroke. It was very devastating. My father isnt the same, and my family fights every day. I have been kicked out the house many times. I break down a lot.","You undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders. Stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father, family conflict, as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule. Stress, if left unchecked has many negative health related implications. First and foremost I would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity. Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 56 free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them. Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe. When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama, but sometimes that can compound our stress. When dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care. In other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace, enjoyment, and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life. Even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress, it is inevitable and a part of life, but how you deal with stress, as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life. I hope this helps..."
"I saw my mother cheating on my dad before. I said something to her, and she said it was in the past. Yesterday, I saw her texting dirty things to the same guy. Should I talk to her again? I dont want my parents to go their separate ways, I just want her to stop. its not fair.","You as the child in the middle of your parents problems is the worse position to be in. I can only imagine your hurt, pain and confusion on what to do. Honestly, this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age, your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end. One thing I would like to note....your parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating, they have already gone their separate ways."
I avoid talking to him because he always makes me more upset. I cant be honest with him about anything because he is always rude to me.,"Hi Troy, I totally get this. Its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him. Your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open. But thats not who your dad is. Your dad is your dad, and waiting for him to change wont really help. Nothing you do can change your dad, but...there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him.While your response of avoiding him is understandable, I wonder what effect it has on your dad. Its possible that hes feeling frustrated, rejected and punished by your withdrawal. You may think he knows that youre feeling hurt, but he probably doesnt. So this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude, so your habit is to be silent, then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated. His frustration comes out as more rudeness, which makes you want to withdraw more, and the cycle starts all over again. You cant change his part of the cycle but you can change yours.Are you willing to take a risk? Can you be honest about how youre feeling? Whats the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad You know why I avoid you? I stay silent because when I talk to you say rude things. So if you want me to talk, I need to know you can listen. I imagine it would come out differently because youre a few generations younger than me, but put that into your own words.I dont know the level of your dads rudeness. If he is abusive, then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this. I dont want to put you at any risk. But if you dont worry your dad will hurt you, maybe give honesty a try.My point is that, as rude as your dad may be, checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude. Its powerful...your silence. Your dad cant read your mind, and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with him.And, if youre both open to it, seeing a therapist together can be really helpful."
She is living with her boyfriend of seven years. He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. He hasnt worked in all this time.,"Congrats on your upcoming grandchild!Does your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy, to the family?Talk with your daughter first, whether or not she would like you to tell other family members.Also, given the other facts you mention in your post, if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable, then bring up these topics too.Stay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours."
"I keep being mean to my best friend, and I dont know why all the time. I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time. Could that be a cause?","Hi Morristown,Theres a saying that goes hurt people hurt people. Its possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mothers behaviours. When we are treated poorly, especially as children, it affects how we ourselves, others, and the world. Its also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour.The good news is that you have this lovely awareness and I think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about. I recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on. Good luck!"
"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I cant seem to forgive her. I want to say that its okay, but I cant. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldnt be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persons way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that youre not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.Youre on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when youve reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!"
"My mom and I have been fighting a lot now, and I just want a good relationship with her.","The best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively. One of the hardest things about this, however, is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame.The best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response. Often, the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication. The hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times."
"I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.","Hi Zionsville. Its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother. You will ALWAYS have that, you know? Hes doing whats natural at his age...spreading his wings and looking for love. You may be heading into that zone soon too, but I get that its weird that hes there before you, and you miss him.Try to respect your brothers autonomy, wish him well, be friendly with his girlfriend, and its also okay to say Hey, bro, Im still here. When can we hang out!?"
"Ive been hurt by a man for five years. He doesnt involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me. There is a Mass today for a family member, and he never asked me to go. Im to sit home alone now and Christmas too. He expects me to sit alone while he enjoys being with the family. We are in our 50s, and it hurts that he wont even think of me or involve me as part of the family. He doesnt even care. I am leaving him as soon as possible, but I hurt so bad that I didnt know who to turn too. Im now in this low funk of depression, and Im scared because I do stupid things to myself and give up. I have no friends because I was a truck driver. Ive been getting serious headaches and cant sleep. I dont eat Ive lost my appetite. This has been going on for a couple weeks now.","Hi Florida,I get the sense that, aside from this relationship, youre quite isolated in general. Its sad that youre feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events. While I would suggest that you dont really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling you assume theyre against you, and that he doesnt care, he is certainly behaving in a very distant, excluding manner and its understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt.How long has this part been happening? Has he always acted this way, or is it more recent? Did something happen recently? You mentioned doing stupid things to yourself, and I dont know what that means. If you are engaging in selfharm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this. Part of the problem, of course, is that you dont know whats going on for him. Certainly, you deserve the truth, and if he doesnt want to spend time with you, I would hope he would be honest. Have you been open to hearing the truth from him? Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why hes being distant? Maybe you could ask him, if you are ready to hear.Im glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full, loving relationship, although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you. Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man? Im just guessing, based on what youve said here.It seems that its possible your situation has led to some depression, and I would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out. You will need support, even if the relationship is repaired. Best of luck."
"Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundingspeople, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. What can I do?","Do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust? Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does. If they dont see these qualities in you, then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you. You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know, specifically, what she is expecting. Then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are, its her issue and she is not coming from a place of love.Even if you do resemble her comments, the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love. The fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you."
"I use to be so happy. No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. Were both teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.","I understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone. Have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other, and what her concerns are? It sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating, and compromising. It is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having to lie to your mom. It would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from. Have either one of you been in family therapy? This may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from. If your mood is sad, and your feeling worse, it is important that you reach out to an adult, parent, person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems."
"Im applying to private high schools. Im playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that Ive hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think its unfair because its up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldnt want to play in high school. Now I dont know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I dont play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom youd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept."
"I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.","Thanks for the question. Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements withI as opposed to you. For example, you can tell him, I feel angry whenyou raise your voice at me instead of Youalways yell at me. Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesnt know how to.Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussionwith something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect ofDad, Ienjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times thatI feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Lets try and work on this together. I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm.I hope you find this useful!"
"I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my exboyfriend. I am now married, and my husbands exgirlfriend is involved with my exboyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my exboyfriend that I dont want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my exboyfriend started discussing dropoff details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughters pickup details are between my husband and his exgirlfriend. I especially told him I didnt want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him. The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I dont understand where I went wrong besides replying back to his question. I feel like Im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other, and its the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughters birthday, and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her. In my eyes, its the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","Hi. I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your exboyfriendseems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on parental alienation. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have.I will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him?. You cant change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. Youre correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that, but thats okay. Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important. Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement. Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself."
"She treats me like Im not in her presence. Shes always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.",Attention is not equal to love and being valued. It may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them. It is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible. It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you. This sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out.
"I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house. Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way? This is not a joke. I am trying to understand.","Hi,This sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem good for you for reaching out! My first thought is, these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places. Since they are adults, and you cant force them to seek treatment, you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider. . As far as what to do for yourself set some firm boundaries. Be clear about the expectations of your home. Also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue. I hope this helps you, your family members, and the pets!"
I am married to a beautiful lady. I love my wife with all my heart. We have 3 boys and I have a daughter from a previous marriage. We also have 3 grandchildren. Now this event is tearing us apart. I want our family to be together and happy. It was a mistake from so long ago. My wife wants to leave and I dont want that to happen I love her so much. Please help me save my marriage. Even my 3 boys want us to work it out. They love us both and want our family together. Please give me some advice or hope. Sincerely heart broken.,"If your wife is willing, seek out a qualified couples therapist! Look for one trained in the Gottman Method or Emotionally Focused Therapy. Your relationship is repairable, but you may need some qualified support in the process."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that Im falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you."
Im having issues with my relative. The police never believe the experiences I have been through because I am only a kid. Ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me. Could you please give me advice?,"I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children. Its called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline. The number is 18004ACHILD 18004224453.It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance, confidentiality, and can also help you make a report of you want.The call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.Im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation. You are a very brave and an intelligent child.Please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger."
The last of my emotions belong to my pets. Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow. If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says here lays my emotions. R.I.P. I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my familys. Whats wrong with me?,"It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about, your pets. I do not know what all is going on in your family, and I cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind this.I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills. We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us. If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress. It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends, hobbies, games, etc. Develop other things that you care about and are passionate about.Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones, you may develop some very unhealthy ones. You have to cope somehow, right? Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.I dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children. One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability. People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe. Both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life. Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse."
"I have secrets in my mind, and I dont know what to do with them. I dont want to tell my wife and mom because I dont want to hurt them. But Im not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself. What should I do? Its becoming annoying and making me anxious. Help me out","It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There are several things to consider before you make a decision. You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them why would it hurt them? Is it necessary for them to know this information? What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? for you and for your wife and mom. Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation? Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you think they would do themselves? If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would you want to know the secrets? How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not."
All we do is argue. We never agree on anything.,"For how long has the arguing been occurring and does it relate to a specific incident or circumstance in your relationship?Arguing due to temporary stress and feeling lost or uncertain, is different than the two of you rarely agree on what foods to buy at the grocery store.In both temporary or longer term arguing, ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriage.If your core principles are rejected, youve been arguing for an extended amount of time, and the value of the marriage doesnt outweigh this, then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it."
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the followingRecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality could be more or less and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideasTry to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isnt acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say okay, Im feeling really stressed about this right now. Lets discuss it in an hour. And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partners top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, fingerpointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quoteConnection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued when they can give and receive without judgment.

"I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she wont tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.","Hi Prattville,Im sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You dont indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question.If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say I need answers to all my questions. Giving you the information she needs has to be if she wants the marriage more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, shes planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door.Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth. Only time and a good therapist, if she is willing and wants the marriage will tell which way this one will go. Individually, you can seek professional help as well."
"Im always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?","Thanks for your question. Communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships. Working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently, a better communicator is going to take some work from your part. You have to calmly be able to express to him your concern and how it affects you. Very important is that you do it in a loving and nonthreatening way. Therefore, the time to have this discussion is not when you are frustrated or need to vent to someone about something important. Focus the discussion on how both of you could benefit from having more meaningful conversations where both parties are being heard and how it is important to you that he hears you just like it is crucial for him to be heard. There is a lot of useful information online about how to be a good listener or therapist in your area that can help you. Be patient and genuine, and he will come around. Best of Luck, Mirella"
"Ive only been married three months. Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.","One key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. When couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward.Im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over? If youre stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about 30 minutes. The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place when things are good between you an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. That way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. Rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs."
"If I tell him I dont like certain things, he does when it pertains to me. He tells me its not like that. He never has anything to say about me until I tell him something about himself.","It sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband. Your perceptions of interactions that you are having dont sound like they match up. It would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using I statements I feelwhen you. This is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person. If you work on communicating in new, less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouses feelings and perspective."
"Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family. However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. Im not sure how to move forward?","First of all, my heart goes out to you. Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome. There are some things that you should consider. First of all, did he seem truly remorseful? If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done, it will give you a piece of mind that it was a mistake.Secondly, was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming, the sting is even more painful. He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.Thirdly, has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this time, he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage, you and the children.Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100 normal.My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist. Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved. I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration, this is not a healthy environment either. If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship, a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needs.Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately, many relationships have endured this very thing. It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles. The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board.Best of luck to you and your family!"
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I dont like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he cant live without it.","Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom, I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! It DOESNT necessarily mean, however that your husband is gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a crossdresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you.That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isnt always what we identify as. Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly dont consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else. It could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc. Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because its the opposite of what their life typically entails e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week.Each of us has a sexual script a blueprint if you will of what we like and dont like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal. Its also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives Gagnon Simon, 1973.Youve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment.ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. Its like our own sex fingerprint.In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ. If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives.Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesBoth partners taking ownership for the couples sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one anothers needs, desires, and wishes while making sure hisher own needs are being met.If pegging your husband as its called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script. However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion andor be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesnt hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!"
"I love him, but he doesnt show me love. He talks badly about me to his friends.","What you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect. The challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try. The only person that you have control of is yourself. So then the question that this reality poses is What are you willing to change? If you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value, if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness, then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that. The change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself, the way you treat yourself and what you accept. Your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well. It would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts. You have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life. Sometimes, the differencechange can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar. Sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation, and sometimes they get left behind. You must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself."
My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia. I have been dealing with that all day. My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said.,"I dont know how long you have been married, but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment. It could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong. Maybe he would be open to an honest discussion?"
"My husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person. Before, he worked and slept, and on off days, hed stay home because he didnt want to do anything else. Now hes going out with friends several nights a week while Im still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself. Hes suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, Im remembering how Ive been emotionally starving for the last five years.","It seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression. Obviously something has shifted which you do not understand. Therefore, perhaps you should consider attending Couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings? It would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on. Communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection, or shut down connection. IMAGO dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection."
"I decided to stay and work it out. I just dont want to sit on the couch. Other than that, I have been getting over the situation. I dont feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and wont leave me alone about it. I can move on and continue to love, laugh, and play with my wife. I just dont want to sit on that couch.","Houston, Its normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger, so I get why you dont want to sit on it, but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive. Am I to assume that you cant afford a new one? Ideally, she buys you a new couch, but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward.t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone."
Im feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just dont feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I dont know why or if Im just being irrational.,"Lacey, Im SO glad you wrote. Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now. Im glad youre paying attention to it.When you first meet someone, there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection. Then what happens is because we have that connection established, we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore. That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years long enough to procreate and keep the human race going, and then it wears off a bit, and you end up looking at each other thinking how come I dont feel the same anymore?Mostly not always, and Ill get to that in a minute all that this means is youve stopped doing all those loving things you used to do! Its as though you filled the car with gas, youve run out of gas now, and youre forgetting to put more in!The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that youve cut back on. Act lovingly, and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. Its okay to say do you remember we used to do X,Y and Z? Can we do that again? Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me? Ask for what you want instead of complaining. What are your love languages? What are your partners?Marriages need to be fed. Its that simple. Many things get in the way...children, jobs, but mostly complacency. Get active with your love!Okay, now, you might read this and think thats not whats happening. Thats a cue to talk to someone, like a therapist, about your feelings. People do grow and change and sometimes relationships dont fit anymore. But these are huge decisions, not to be made lightly.I wish you happiness."
"I have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man. I talked to her about it, and she said she will do it for me. The idea excites me to no end, but I dont want to because it disgusts me. How can I stop wanting it, or should I just give into it and do it? Ive been struggling for years with this. It wont go away. By the way, I am in my mid 30s and my wife is in her mid 40s.","Try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilled.Since you and your wife are in a relationship, the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wife.I suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangement,By anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control, or in control, since its your wish being fulfilled, all the feelings you and her are able to expect, youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode, which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the event.There are a lot of unknowns in the situation youre considering. Having your partner, who will be key in satisfying your sex wish, be active in understanding these unknowns, is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall."
"My husband and I have been together since high school. We have been married going on for nearly ten years, and we have three beautiful children. A few weeks ago, my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dads for a while. He comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong. Can this marriage be saved or is it too late? He said he would go to counseling, so I dont think he has given up.","While it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support. With appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible. Im not familiar with the resources available in Jackson but Im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy.So often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress, loneliness, anger and resentment. I commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children. The following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separatingand also videos and other resources that can help you get started.Wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery."
"That phrase makes me crazy. It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change, such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie. Another example is when he opens the front door, the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up. Over and over again, he lets the dog run out, and I am afraid he will get hit by a car.","I empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to him.When the immediate situation has calmed down, have you ever told him that this upsets you? Is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to you?Keep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change, may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to change.A helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down, is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happened.By learning more about how the other person thinks and feels, it will be easier to know what to expect form each other.Even if you disagree about what is best, knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept, or at least not be surprised and startled by them.Sending good luck to both of you!"
"My husband doesnt trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over that I am messing around, which I am not.","Im sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship. Trust, as you clearly know, is essential to healthy relationships. Past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances. We tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security.Rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties. On your end, you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy, gestures of transparency e.g. giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with, letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities, and more patience and empathy for his fears.On his end, he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you, attempting to control you, or limiting your freedom.If you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life, I would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist."
"My husband and I wouldve been married for five years come June 2016. Our infant daughter just had her birthday. Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didnt want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant. It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. Ive tried to research online, but Im not getting any answers. He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? Where do you recommend researching this?","This sounds really difficult and I can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband? continues to have a relationship with you and your children. With that being said relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for. In order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges, something that you say your ex is not willing to do. While it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices."
My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad. It was a time when my health was poor. Im have a hard time moving on.,"How has your husband acted since then? Was he regretful? How did you find out? Did he confess? These are all things that you want to consider. Betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over, know that this is normal.Hopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this.Its also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place i.e. being honest with how hes feeling so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.If the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldnt repeat the same mistake. However, if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. If the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings. In return, your husband should be patient and understanding of this.Also, marriage counselors are often a good goto as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations.Best of luck to you!"
"I have been with my husband for almost 7 years. We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned. I was happy but I couldnt help feeling disappointed too. I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldnt help how I was feeling. We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds. I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted. I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding. What I wanted will never happen. I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset. I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just cant control it. Its ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it. Plus, I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed. Why cant I move on?","Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement. This was something that you and most women think about for years, so its understandable to be disappointed. But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect. You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either.However, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing. How many women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? I assure you that there are plenty.Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. Focus on what you can control NOW. Perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately. But after that, close that chapter and move on. It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change."
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"There is an organization dedicated to helping individuals find affordable counseling. It is called Open Path Collective. There is a one time membership fee of 49 and it lasts for your lifetime.

"Ive been bulimic for about 6 years now. Im in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all. I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style youre already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of selfdoubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where youd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!"
"I have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress. I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager. Are there any coping mechanisms I can use to break this cycle?","Hello,This question describes a very typical setup of what is called the Binge, Repent, Repeat cycle. This means that typically after you binge, you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent i.e. vow to never binge again, promise to do better, go to the gym, etc. and then ultimately end up bingeing again.There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating. Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally, eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day, with snacks in between. IF you binge, then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors, and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating, then this actually leads to a binge again. Thus, reverting you back to the cycle. If you binge, it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge. Although it may feel counterproductive, getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle.It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred, it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past. Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge, or the way that you handled the situation?Lastly, if youre struggling with normalizing eating, it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally, mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

"I have no self control over food. Most people stop when theyve had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets Im never done eating dessert.","Hello! Im so glad you decided to write in today. This is such a great question and Im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing. There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern.First, I think its important to understand food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies, provide us with energy and yes, sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures, we place a LOT of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. Whats more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every gettogether. And if its not? Well, then forget about it!I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office, and its almost like donuts have never been there before! Must eat one or two!However, we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence, or similar ones, will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before, and they will be there again on another day. During these moments, I like to have my clients employ a StopandThink method. StopandThink about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also, I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not, it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut.Another aspect we need to remember about food, is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions, we can then determine where theyre coming from, as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.The most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start, please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands.There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com. In addition, I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and I would love to help! Amber"
Theres this boy who asked me out awhile ago. I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me. How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends?,"Since youve decided to be with the boy who already showed you his interest, then why not simply tell him you decided to accept his invitation to be together?Probably your first concern about hesitating to accept this boy into your life due to the way you imagine your family may react if you do, is the more complex matter to solve.Forming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own. At the same time, we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew up.Your dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual, including your choice of partner, and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a couple.Stay true to what you feel, whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolving.This will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are."
"I have suffered many things at home and school. We never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that, but I always feel like a part of my heart is missing. I try to fill it in with objects or, in this case, a woman.",Maybe the reason is not having confidence in the love you give to yourself.Possibly you consider the quality of your selflove as inferior to love someone else gives you.The best way to push through to your own selfcomfort and acceptance is to be aware of this tendency so you can remind yourself to practice appreciating the unique love you give to yourself.
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends. I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?,"It is not the case of being right or wrong, in my view. If you are asking, I believe you trulycare for your boyfriend. It seems like he is having difficulties in establishing trust in this relationship. The ideal would be to come closer to his upsetness and to show him that you are there for him. I hope all goes well. Rossana Mag."
Ive been with my partner for 4 years. Shes given me no reason not to trust her. But lately Ive been overreacting a lot when shes just doing normal things. I think its triggering my bad past relationships. How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?,"Two paths are possible.Youre not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriend.You are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this person.The only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feel.This will allow new light to open an answer as to the truth.Once you know what truly is going on between the two of you, your selftrust naturally will grow stronger.Selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust."
Ive been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says its just a crush but I dont know how to cope with it. How should I deal with this?,"I can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear. On one hand, most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us, but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful. So let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings, even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else. Quite honestly, the brain cant help it. It sees something good looking and it pays attention. And when we pay attention to something good, our brains send out neurochemicals associated with that happy thought...and we get a rush of what your girlfriend is labeling a crush. The difficulty here is deciphering whether she was just attempting to honor her commitment to you by sharing this feeling OR if she is continuing to feed those feelings. I would encourage you to thank her for being honest if you havent already, and ask her to further describe the nature of these feelings and what shed like to do from here. As weird as it is to say, at the end of the day, what helps the most is typically reassuring yourself that you WILL be okay not matter what! That it is worth it to invest in your relationship and give it your all and if someday, god forbid, this woman chooses to walk away, then she is not the one. Will it hurt? Of course. But is it the end? Hell no! There are 7.5 billion people on the planet and I firmly believe statistically speaking alone, there are at least several hundred thousand that could be AMAZING partners for you.

"Ive been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but its hurting so much.","If I understand you correctly, this maybeboyfriend has done a partial break up, and wants to maintain a partial relationship. Is that ok with you? And, if it is, what does it cost you? He says hes done but still wants the connection. That seems to leave him free to explore other options, but it doesnt allow you to do the same.Break ups are painful, and I know youd like to avoid that. I get it that you feel attached to him you have been in a relationship with him for 4 years, so that makes sense. However, loving him appears to be costing you a lot, without much in return.If you wait for him to define what he wants, you could be on hold for a long time.Please dont wait another year to advocate for yourself. See a therapist who can help you figure out what you need out of relationships and why you have allowed yourself to be on pause. It is possible that once you get clear, you will be able to have a true relationship with him. If not, please dont settle for this.Take good care of yourself."
Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"What an important question, and the fact that youre asking it is a big step in the right direction. To answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred that woke you up to the fact that youre not listening as well as you could and that youre running the risk of losing her.Given that I dont have all that information, Ill offer one simple suggestion. Your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship. You could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize youre not yet understanding what she needs andyou really want to. Then take a deep breath, settle down, and listen. Dont argue, dont interrupt, dont judge... listen. Let her know what you understand and that youre open to hearing more, learning more if youre not quite getting it yet... and then listen some more. Be present and curious about this person you love dearly and dont want to lose. This is the first step toward intimacy."

I told him I liked him. He called me lovely and pretty but he said he didnt want a relationship. He would always flirt with me.,"Well, as disappointed as you may very well feel from hearing this guys answer, you know he doesnt want a relationship.What type of move would you like him to make?If you mean youd be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship, then wait for as long as your patience allows.To wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship, doesnt have a very strong base on which to stand.Its possible to do this only consider the emotional price of your frustration to wait for someone to change their mind."
"Im in a longdistance relationship with my ideal man, but Im not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the perfect guy? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes overrated. Im curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you should be What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him?The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a longdistance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men.Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each others bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man everything else is perfect about him. Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love."
"I met this girl in high school. She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since. Its been a few years. We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.","One way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way youd handle a similar situation in the future.Since a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis, right now youve got no idea if youd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years ago.The relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner. That you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize. This way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property. To have lots of similar interests, is another quality you appreciate in a partner.The more you know about what you do and dont like in a partner, the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path."
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant. I dont know what to do to fix the relationship.,"My empathy goes out to you. Relationships are tough enough and im sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you. You are confused and want to mend the relationship with him, but are finding it so hard to do. Relationships require both people to work consistently in order to keep them happier, but if it is only you that is actively trying to repair the relationship, it can be emotionally draining.Perhaps expressing you feel using I, you statements can be beneficial. Do not accuse him or use you statements like you are so distant or you dont even care.Start out sharing your feelings by saying I feel sad when you dont return my phone calls or I feel confused about our relationship ever since you have been keeping to yourself. He may have a valid point, or might have been hurt by the argument and retreated as a result of it. Regardless of why, use this time as a great opportunity to practice healthy communication.If you think you are not ready for a conversation like that, couples counseling can be excellent. You will have a skilled facilitator guide the conversation and help you both communicate with one another."
"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didnt work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course theres a reason!Theres always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow."
"My boyfriend is always saying hes done with me and says hes leaving, but then at the end of the night, hes still here. He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.","Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to it?Are you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him better?Basically, first know your own reason for your question. Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you. In the best of cases, he doesnt realize how his actions affect you and he will change."
I was with my boyfriend for years on and off. We dated and broke up three times. Since we broke up five months ago I cant move on. I want to get back together but he wont talk to me. What should I do?,"Probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for you.When a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly. A break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life, not only that the person is no longer connected with us.Since your boyfriend isnt talking to you then youre keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions. Theres nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking, this person is the only one whos in charge to start talking.Maybe since youve had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before youre willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanent.Be patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship. Once enough time passes so that youre considerably past the point at which you and he come together, then accepting his leavetaking will feel natural.Right now its very understandable to have hope since youve been on this road before. In time youll have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not."
"I really like this guy and I think he likes me back, but his sister is my bestfriend. Im afraid that if I tell her I have a crush on her brother she would loose it. I once told her I thought her brother was cute and she got really angry. Ive gotten to know her brother better lately and Ive realized he may actually feel the same way. I dont want to lose her friendship. What do I do?","Do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted, ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sisteryour friend, isnt?If yes, then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each other.If no, then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact youre attracted to the brother.Find out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brother.Anything is possible from, shed like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did, wouldnt like or react negatively.Or, if protection isnt your friends reason, then maybe shes fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brother.Friends are people who care about each others lives. Let your friendship with this girl work on behalf of each of you!"
I feel like I took our relationship for granted and hes now to the point that hes giving up. I have had trouble feeling like I could trust him but hes given me no reason not to trust him. I know my attitude is also a big issue for him. I have a lot of obligations at home so we dont spend a lot of time together. How can I fix this relationship?,"A key factor in a relationship is trust.Id start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bf.Does this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships, or with a sibling or parent?Its also possible youre intuitively sensing you cant trust your bf bc hes not trustworthy. Sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emerge.Also, your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trust.Its possible youre feeling his own selfprotection about being in a relationship with you.The best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with him.Whatever the underlying tensions are, talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship."
"Whenever I sing along with a song that I like even if its just for the beat and not the lyrics, my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship. I dont why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song. Now I cant enjoy and sing a song without him thinking Im trying to give him a hint. He even accuses me of cheating and lying. Its driving me nuts. I love him and would never do such an awful thing ever. How can I get him to understand?","Well, have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote here?This will give him the same understanding youre allowing us to have here on this site.Keep in mind that the best, the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you, still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information, is in his hands only.Try to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself. Another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him. This may open a wider discussion about what he feels hed like from you so he feels good in the relationship."
"I have a lot of child custody concerns, financial issues, insecurities and weigh gain. I also have no local family support. Its hard for me to stay positive. I get very emotional and take it out on the people I love. How can I stay strong?","Theres online forums and blogs, some of which have interactive discussion groups.Also, depending on exactly what you mean by becoming emotional, feeling overwhelmed by feelings typically happens when people feel a lot of stress and pressure in their lives. Loneliness contributes to feeling overwhelmed too.Your feelings may be perfectly normal.Similarly, depending on what you mean take it out on people, you may be expecting too much of yourself.If youre expecting other people to listen to your upset feelings, this is reasonable.If youre harming them as a a result of your upset feelings, this is unreasonable.Depending on what exactly you are doing when you take it out, you may be quite reasonable to do so."
"I was talking to my fiance about changing my hair. He recommended a very specific hair style. Then I found out his ex has that exact same hair. I feel like he must know she has that hair style. Am I nuts, or does this show that hes still in love with her?","Maybe your finances hair preference for you reflects he still is in love w the ex.There are other many reasonable options too.Maybe he doesnt know a lot about hair styles, or didnt want to even think through the question carefully and also didnt want to tell you this directly.He may have tried to take the easy way out of involving himself in your question.The key whether or not he loves you is how you feel most of the time in your relationship. If most of the time you trust the sense you are loved and you love him, then this gives you some reassurance about how the both of you feel toward each other.It is possible too that your finance has some remaining feelings for the ex. Whether or not this makes any difference to you depends on how stable and reliable you feel is the love between the two of you."
My girlfriend recently started hanging out a lot more with one of her friends who did her wrong in the past and just walked out on her. So for the past 3 years its been just me and my girlfriend. Things have been great up until the last month. Now she ignores me and texts and hangs oit with her friend more and more. I dont know what to do anymore. My girlfriend is so distant. How do I keep from losing her?,"Well, if you each want to be with the other, than no one will be lost.Have you told her about feeling slighted? Start telling her about your feelings. How she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friend.Who knows, maybe the friend has problems of her own and your gf is spending extra time w the friend to help the friend, and doesnt even know you feel hurt.You would do yourself and your gf a lot of good to tell more about your feelings. Either you will get more closeness and consideration, or not. At least you will have the truth."
I dont know how to tell someone how I feel about them. How can I get better at expressing how I feel?,"Practice makes perfect!Simply by expressing yourself and listening to if others listen and understand you, then modifying your next try with whatever improvements you think of based on the impressions you feel others have of you, will progress your selfexpression.Also, one way to lessen the tension before speaking to someone is to tell them you feel unsure on how best to express yourself. This way youve prepared them to be patient with whatever words you do state."
"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. Ive been really sad lately and for the past few months Ive realized Im just way too dependent on him. It makes me really upset to be so dependent on someone else, but I cant help it. I dont even know who I am without him. How can I be less dependent on my him?","From what you write youve got good motivation to change and awareness as to what youd like to change.These are very good predictors that youll be successful in what youd like to change.Try, the next time you realize youre depending on your bf instead of friends, yourself, to interrupt whatever typical action youd take.Do something different instead!If when youd like advice and usually ask your bf, ask a different trusted someone.Or, when you feel lonely, contact a friend or introspect on your own if usually youd contact your bf.Also, being dependent on a bf is part of a trusting intimate relationship. Dependency in the sense that you each are reliably available to each other, is a good quality.Only if it seems excessive, such as youre isolating yourself from other close friendships, is dependency on a partner, a problem."
"I feel so alone. I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. They say it will all be okay, or they dont listen to me st all. Everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?","We feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self. When you find that nobody is around do you feel alone? Your never alone. Once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you, there will never be an alone moment.We seek outside of self to fill inside.

"I dont speak up if Im uncomfortable and hardly ever make plans for us when we hang out. He is a very open and straightforward person, so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication. Weve been together two years and have identified this as our main problem. Arguments have arised from this single issue many times.","Do you know what youre afraid may happen if you do speak up?Usually people dont talk freely because they feel afraid to do so. Sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other, of being criticized or judged by the other person, or that what you will say stirs anger in the other person.If you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking, then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hard.Also, since speaking up is new for you, then ask your partner to be patient while you learn to do so. Everyone does better at learning new skills when they feel supported and welcomed."
"Weve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me. Its hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I dont want a broken family because we cant communicate.","Under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge. So, while you still look like grown ups, your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you. In simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you, and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience, and that still fell short of what you needed. You are both still trying to get very early needs met.The best advice I can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up, and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful. And seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck point.Avraham Cohen, Ph.D, R.C.C., C.C.C."

Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it."
My boyfriend called me a particular profanity and I broke up with him. This is the third time hes called me this and Im just completely done with giving him chances. He knows how much it bothers me. I just want to know if Im over reacting.,"It sounds like you are reacting to an issue in communication patterns, rather than a particular word. The ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship. If your partner is not listening to, acknowledging and remembering your wishes, that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship."
"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck.","It sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close. Do you typically spend most of your time together? If so, it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart. If any separation is difficult, you may need to examine why. Think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious, upset or worried about. If you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief. It is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone, it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend."

Weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker. I dont know how to approach this situation. How do I ask him about it?.,"I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. Its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support, openess, understanding, empathy, you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca"
"We werent long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but its complicated. He said hes not going to find someone else, but Im afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","Hello. You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship. Although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.Without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on what if situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. Its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life. Other times, it is Making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for longdistance ones.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca"
"When I ask him who he is talking to, he tells me no one. But, it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone. I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone. I ask so much, I feel like I am losing it. Is he trying to make me question my sanity, or is he talking to himself?","A rare topic likely extremely troublesome for you... I would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight. Feel free to email me.I would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring, as your partner, he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level. Partners need each others trust and support, no matter who is right or wrong."
"Over a year ago I had a female friend. She turned out to be kind of crazy so I decided to stop talking to her. When she would call me I wouldnt answer the phone. This made my girlfriend really suspicious. She would ask me why I wouldnt ever answer that phone number. I told my girlfriend that I dont want to be friends with that other woman, but I dont think she believes me. How can I get my girlfriend to understand?","We women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game. And Hollywood culture hasnt helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, theres something to worry about.Its been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. For exampleWhere did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?Why dont you want to be friends with her i.e., what do you mean by kind of crazy? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other womans hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about, she may start to come around.Now, IF shes more concerned that you might be taking this womans calls behind your back, while Im not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this females number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea. Bottom line show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you CHOSE HER. And would continue to do so all over again. AND why you love HER as a person. This will help her trust what youre saying.Best of luck to you! Tamara Powell, LMHC"
"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I cant be happy without him. How do I get away from this relationship?","Im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly be alone, even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you."
"We had great chemistry, but then he became distant. I had the feeling that I cant be without him. As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him. I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.","People often care deeply for those whom they love. I dont know how long you have been together. It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you.It may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away. It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you. For example, maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he can.Sometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you. You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy, you have the ability to write a message, and he has the ability to answer when he can.I also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened. I dont know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your life.Some people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry, but this is difficult for others.I would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special.Also think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argument.It may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelming.Perhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person. Remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another."
"Im in my early 20s. My exs parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesnt have to be.I dont know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations."
"I try to do everything right just so we wont argue, and it doesnt help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol. I get anxiety over having fights with him.","Because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights, it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fights.When you do everything right, are you saying that you dont argue? It sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively. I recommend working on this with a therapist, though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions, so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm."
"Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way I like you as a friend, or I love your attention but not you.",Attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time. Maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection.
"Im dating a guy I really love. We have our problems, but I could see myself with him long term. But theres this other guy who Ive had feelings for for awhile now. He gives me butterflies when we talk, and my heart beats fast when I see hes texted me, which i never felt with my current boyfriend.","There are different types of attraction. You said that youve never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend. Depending on how long youve been together and if youre looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level, thats a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different. Some people look at it as a difference between levels of passion and compassion, but there are many different terms to try to talk about it.Perhaps with this guy that you really love, you could talk about ways to keep things new and different in the relationship. Maybe you can leave notes for each other during the day or have a small surprise at random intervals maybe an invitation to a picnic, for example.As for the other guy who makes your heart beat faster, what do you see in him? You said you really love the other guy, which is why Im asking.What do you look for in the person who you want to be with longterm whoever that is?"
"My exboyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. Hes in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. Ive tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.","There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave. Can you have open conversations about your concerns? Is he able to listen to that? Im not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats, but does he recognize these things as problems? Which part of you is bigger the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? Can you consider what you want, wish for, and desire while also considering the same for him? Can he do that for you?"
"Im in a relationship, but I feel like Im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and thats lingering in the back of my mind.","The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter. Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter. Thats why it didnt work with him btw. He wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered. However it ended, clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you. So here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message. Move on. You arent unworthy, you just havent found a man who is worthy of you!To be worthy of you, he must see your worth. Often though before anyone else can see your worth, you have to believe it."
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you dont matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure so congrats on that because clearly you are already there! Next Id suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually."
"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi,First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain your ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one.As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people inthe relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you.I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up i.e. are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth. An excellent resource would be the book Opening Up by Tristan Taormino.I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFTC"
i was addicted to porn since the second grade. Im in my early 40s and overcame my addiction during my separation from my wife of 15 years.,The person who can answer this question is the person you want to rebuild that trust with. They are the only one who can tell you what it will take for them to trust you again. What they tell you may seem hard or impossible but unfortunately that is what THEY need. It is up to you if you feel and know you can provide what they request.
"He isnt violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. Hes working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining."
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","Youll only find out whether or not it is too late, by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what youd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity youve had for some time."
"Ive been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","It sounds like youre pulling away instead of being honest. If you really want to be with him, why not now? If you dont have time for a relationship, why are you dating at all?I dont understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting, where you just stop talking and disappear!. I get the sense that this relationship isnt working for you, but for some reason youre stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it. In the early stage of a relationship the first year, if it doesnt feel fabulous, its a good idea to move on. Its not personal. You dont owe this person anything. They deserve someone whos totally into them and so do you and youre doing him no favors by hanging on to something thats not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime. You dont have to slowly bow out. It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty. Maybe people dont know how to say it?Ive decided not to continue with this. I wish you the best.Life is too short!"
"I found out my boyfriend takes antidepression medicine. Lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. Weve only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.","Give him the time and space he needs. Obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process, think about, and work through. Respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers. If and when he is ready to talk, he will. When and if he does talk, be a comforting listener and put yourself in his shoes the best you can to be the support he needs. Dont take it personal because you just been dating 3 weeks and his depression maybe something that been going on for a while. If you do like him...showing him by being patient and supportive at this time."
Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year. We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out. But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me. Now he wants me to wait on him to mature. He wants to talk to other people. Then come back in four years. He doesnt want to deal with me while Im pregnant. He doesnt take me to the doctor or anything. I feel alone. How do I handle this situation?,"Well, as far as your boyfriend, sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice. Leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned. However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level. Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up. This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do. Hopefully, someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listen.As for you, how do you handle this situation is your question....you do what you have to do to prepare for your baby, with or without him. A lot can happen in four years and you dont have time, are not required, and cant wait to see what will happen with him. You have a LIFE to prepare for, to feed, to protect, and to love. Can you tell your baby to wait I dont want to deal with you now I need to mature I will be back to see you later Hope you will be fine? Nope!!! As I always say, you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing. Develop healthy friendships...whether with family, friends or new people who may enter your life. Your support system will grow and life will go on...with or with him. Stay focus on you and your baby..."
I have several issues like I dont like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I dont stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I cant hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I dont fit in. Every day I wake up its like another day. Any info would be good.,"Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain. I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically. Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist. Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms. After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing. Whether treatment includes medication andor psychotherapist would be discussed. Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up."
"Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isnt the same. Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?",Or...better yet... Is it you still thinking about the other girl? I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally andmay haveaffected your sexual performanceas well. Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well.Sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about.
"I was in a relationship with him for three years. My mom doesnt like it because she thinks Im making a mistake. He got married a few months after we broke up, and now he is divorced. I forgave him for what he did in the past, and he says hes sorry and he really loves me. I love him too, but is it bad that Im giving him a second chance again?","Hey, it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes. Your mom wants to protect you I get that. Maybe she is worried youll be hurt again. Were you hurt in some way by him? Can you understand where shes coming from?Sometimes when were mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom, its hard to know how to repair moms relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite. Can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him isnt the total picture? She might need help there.Thank your mom for her love and care, and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether youre together or not, that its a risk you are going to take, and that you really need her support."
"I am currently living in a hotel and I dont have a family. I met a guy a month ago. He is a bisexual. He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites. He would not help pay for the room. When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it. I slapped him and asked him to leave my room. We recently just got back together. One time I was sick. He came to visit and feed me but left no money. Then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that I have struggles living at a hotel. He says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever I need someone to have sex with. He left his bath soap so he could come and get it. I think that he is trying to find a way to come back. Please help me. Whats going on? I am a good, loyal woman. Why is he treating me like this?","I am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends, than about how you feel is treating you. You are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation. If you have friends to talk to, please reach out. While this man has money, it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together. It sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected. I would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care. This is not your fault. But you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs. Take care."
"About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her familys house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didnt understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore. I was crushed! A few days later, she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love, not just sex, but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her childs sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesnt work out for her, we will try again. Im completely in love with her, and Im in extreme pain.",That sounds really heartbreaking. It is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side. It sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out. While I admire your desire and courage to stay friends the extreme pain that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself. Since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you I would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you dont end up feeling strung along or resentful. Make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken.
"I got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years. We both fell in love and have been together for eight months. He left the house and filed for divorce. He decided to tell her about our relationship, and she is willing to forgive and work on things. This shook him. They have two kids together. He decided to put the divorce on hold. He left town for a month to get clarity on the situation and see a therapist.","Hi Miami, I feel your sadness you might have planned a future with your best friend. We live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection. I believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enough.Your friend came face to face with what leaving the marriage meant...huge changes and many intense emotions. He is wise to consider his choices carefully especially if you have children, there is good reason to work at a relationship that is less than fulfilling. Therapy can help.So you fell in love with a man who was in an unstable place. Hes taking the steps to create some stability for himself and that leaves you on hold, not knowing what his decision will be. I love that you seem willing to give him the space he needs to figure it all out. This decision is his.For yourself, you can accept that being best friends with a man might not be a wise thing. Many marriages dont fair well when friendships like that exist. You flirted with danger both of you. You fell in love but he wasnt free, really. Im sure his love for you is real and powerful, but its not a competition. Its one man choosing his life path. You can focus on thoughts like thisHe has the right to choose his life.We flirted with danger by being best friends.I know he does love me this is not a reflection on my worth.I can feel really good about giving him patience and the space he needs.I feel proud of his honesty.I feel proud if hes willing to fight for his marriage lucky her...lucky kids.Acknowledge and allow yourself to feel that sadness, that grief. Its real.If you have told anyone about the affair, seek the support of that trusted person and know you have to grieve this in silence because it was born in silence. I wish you well, and for the record, Im proud of the maturity you show in this situation."
"I have been dating my boyfriend for a month, and we want a baby. We dont work or drive, and we havent talked to our parents. What should we do?","Hi Athens, When a teenager wants to have a baby, its usually for a specific, and not healthy, reason. Do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship? It doesnt work that way. Do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply? Babies dont give to us we give endlessly to them. I urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally. A relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this. Youre only starting to get to know each other. I wish you well and hope you talk to someone."
"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. Im not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but Im not ready for another relationship, and I dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends.","Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energy.Stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that youre not ready for another relationship.From what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then youll be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.Who knows?It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.Good luck with Step One, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship."
My partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process. Its especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him. I feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me.,"Hold on, Sanger! You know, I meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes, they wonder if its best to go back. I dont think so.If your ex is using the children to manipulate, or is generally controlling the separation process, thats confirmation that getting out was the right decision.Your partner feels powerless to change the current situation. Of course he does, because there are many things that are beyond his control his exs behaviours, for one. Accept the powerlessness. Lean into it. Its okay, because there are many things he does have power over, and thats where he can focus.He has the power to give his children a happy dad. Thats HUGE. Thats why he left, Id guess. I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. Thats his exs voice...thats what she wants him to feel...to give into that is letting her win. Ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right. He has not intentionally harmed his children. Hopefully hes aware that the separation has affected them and hes working to create peace and balance in their lives, but hes can let go of the shame she wants him to feel its crippling him.He has the power to separate emotionally from his ex. Hes not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions. Hes still reacting to her. He hasnt completely left yet.A good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions, combat shame, create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries. He needs your support in moving forwards, not going backwards. I wish you the best."
"My girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because I said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers. I have been trying to get her back, but it isnt easy. She is in her 50s and I am in my 40s. She is the one I want for my life, and this is killing me. Every day, I cry, and I am desperate for help.","New York, what would it mean about you if you got her back? Is that the only way you can like or forgive yourself...if she forgives you and takes you back? Your self respect doesnt need to rely on this working with her. She simply doesnt want to be with you, and every day that you refuse to honour her decision is another day that you hurt her all over again. Move on and heal, perhaps with the help of a therapist."
"Im a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I dont really believe him. Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves. He knows that I still crush on him. He doesnt rub it in my face. Hes a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.","First off, I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings,and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....Im not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. Be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. Good luck to you!"
"I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasnt honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didnt realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies. Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?","It sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other. Do you know what type of relationship you want with him? A friendship only,casual dating,or an exclusive relationship? I would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling. Ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well. Be mentally preparedfor a variety of responses from himso that there are no major surprises.By clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are, you can then move forward with a plan. Without that clarification, there will likely be false assumptions, unanswered questions, and confusion."
"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Years Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Lets start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason. Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as feeling like crap and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men arent sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!"
"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says its going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like Im being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldnt care less. I think Im running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship. Its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space.Do you think hes going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have.I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. Thebottomline is you cant make someone love you, and you cant make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you and the choices they make has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future."
"Im an early 20 something yearold virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. Hes cheated on me twice once in the beginning and then four months ago. He wasnt use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasnt sure. We both work at the same job where we met and its with the girl that works with us. Ive been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and selfesteem are low, and sometimes I feel like hell do it again or that hes not ready to be with me. I think about it all over again when I see her. He says hes in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it didnt feel right, and thats when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me. Hes contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because hes in a relationship with me. How do I gain confidence? Should I let him go? If I let him go, I dont want to be sad about it being that we work together. I try to tell myself Im beautiful every day, and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality, but I dont like the fact that she works there.","Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationship.Youre on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend.Since he was the one who broke your trust, he is one in the position of earning back your trust.This is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelity.Understand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationship.If yes, then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationship.For example, some people who are getting over being cheated on, would like knowing details about the affair person, some people want to see the phone of the one who cheated.Recuperating after a cheating incident takes many months.If he tells you hed like earning back your trust, give him some time to see if there is progress in this area.As results unfold, you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally taking.About the girl at work, she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationship.She has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to take.As you go along this road, more than likely, youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you."
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you cant control having these thoughts is accurate. Its also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you arent choosing to have these thoughts. Im sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner."
"My boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago. I love him, but his dog is wrecking my house. Every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up including the couch. Hes slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere. Even though I come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance. I cant financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house. Ive tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well. The dog is the only thing we fight about because I want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesnt want to see him go. Its not the dog fault though I understand that. The dog is only a year old, and he isnt a bad dog. Hes just too big of a dog for where he is he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog. I dont hate the dog, but I just cant afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.","Every living creature needs time and support to adjust to a new situation.The dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason. This may explain what sounds like the dogs agitation. Have you spoken with your boyfriend on his opinion on how to address the dog behavior problems?Finding an answer together would be a good way of making your relationship stronger. Alot of being a couple who live together is talking, listening and deciding together on how to handle major situations.If it is affordable, then a dog behaviorist may be of great help. The person would guide you in working with the dog to become calmer."
"I had to go to the emergency room today to get an Xray of my spine. My boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me. Instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited. When I was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. He doesnt understand why Im mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. He thinks I dont have a reason to be mad, but I believe that I do.","It is extremely frustrating when our significant other doesnt understand our points of view. Often times, arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point, as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others perspectives.Try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing. Communicate how you feel without placing blame and without yelling. Addionally, give him ideas of what he can do differently so that he understands what your expectations are. Lastly, consider seeing a couples therapist who can assist with teaching more effective communication techniques. Best of luck."
"My fianc doesnt think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his exgirlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. Theres a chicken and an egg, and I dont know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that?When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then its not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. Hes not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that.At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesnt send you a good message, right?See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because youve been overreacting when he gets a text? So let him know you wont blow up about him getting a text if he doesntconceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if hes aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear.Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully hell give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him."
"My longdistance girlfriend is in a sorority, and its changing her. I feel like Im becoming less important to her and it hurts. She just wants me to support the sorority, but its so hard. I try every day to show her shes the most important thing to me, but she cant even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that I wont worry about her doing anything regretful. We love each other, but were in a rough patch.","You may already be doing as much as possible for your relationship.Each of you are 50 of the relationship.Is the 50 which your GF contributes to your relationship, based on the same understanding of the couples problem, as you have?Maybe a good starting place for the two of you to talk about is defining what problem the two of you have as a couple.This way, each of you will be able to know if you have similar values and definitions of your reasons for being together.Depending on what you each expect from your partnership, you each will clearly know whether, and then how, to accommodate the other person.These discussions stir a lot of emotions in each person, so that sometimes staying clear minded becomes very difficult. You both will likely feel like talking about these matters more than one time.Consider utilizing a professional, credentialed and licensed therapist who would help the two of you stay on track with examine your emotional connections in a fair and safe way.Good luck with understanding and appreciating your relationship!"
"Every once and a while, I think about my exboyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. Its like I cant get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now weve become friends, but theres this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when were physically in the same place. Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. Im now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know were a really good match. Weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. Hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didnt want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. Im sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. Theyre supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my exboyfriend, and I feel like he does too. I dont know what to do. I need some closure or Im not going to be able to move on from this. I dont know what it is, but its driving me crazy. Im so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. Hes such a good person. I also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I cant get it out of my head. Im trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I cant sleep because my mind is racing. Ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever. I want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend, but I dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I dont want to. Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.","If youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else, its important to pay attention to that. Although you say youre happy, Id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason. Thats a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You cant have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isnt greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future."
"After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time. The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye. My heart is burning, and I cant take this pain.","Ouch. Losing someone you love hurts so much. We all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful. While it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances, I would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life. When we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family. While no one is going to be able to make it better, we dont have to be alone with our pain. If you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for."
"My exboyfriend and I met over a year ago. We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick. However, he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating. When I found out I was pregnant, we had just broken up. Five months later, I lost the baby, and we did not speak for a few weeks. Now we are talking, and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him again. I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much, and I want to get back to us being happy and a family.","Im truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time.When we are in relationships, trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship. Often, when we feel we are required to prove ourselves, feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive. In situations like this, I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner. Your fears about his response are valid, as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact.If you feel comfortable doing so, you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them. You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses. In the end, these are issues that you cannot conquer for him you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust. You may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to, as well. But in terms of your question, only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense."
"My exboyfriend, will not stop harassing and stalking me. We work together. I honestly think he needs help to move on. His accusations are angry lies. But I think he may believe them to be true.","The specific laws about this will vary from state to state. Generally, the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else, or if they are unable to care for themself. More importantly, is dealing with your safety. Most states have laws that make stalking a crime. You might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him. You could also think about contacting a local counselor. While you cant force him to get help with moving on from the relationship, counseling could help you to deal with what is going on."
"My boyfriends sneaky and puts his friends before me. He fights just to leave. One day, hes happy. The next, hes mean and blames me for everything. He cant admit faults. He thinks hes perfect and does no wrong.","Hi, Ontario. I live in the other Ontario in Canada. Ill try to help you sort this out. You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend!It sounds like hes maybe a bit immature and moody, and these things affect you, for sure. I get it.Itsgot me curious, and if I was working with you, Id want to know a lot more about how long youve been together andwhats actually working well between you two. I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description. What tells you hes sneaky? Does he lie? How do you know he lies to you? Also, are you wanting to make things better with him, do you just want an ear to vent to, are you looking for validation, or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation? It helps me if I know what you want.Whenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend, I encourage them first to look at the language theyre using. Some of your words tell me that you think you know what hes thinking that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks hes perfect. Its always tricky when we assume what someones thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. Id encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours because you really cant know what hes thinking unless he tells you. As a general rule, the When you do X, I feel Y sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So, its fair to say when you lie to me, I cant trust you, or when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like Im not important to you, or your mood swings are difficult for me, or I dont seem to get apologies from you. Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationship.That said, I have to ask...if you havent been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that youre leaving out, you dont seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is whats happening.Theres a lot to sort out here...how to communicate about your needs, how to know when to call it quits if something doesnt feel good... I wish you the best as you continue to examine these questions with assistance from friends or professionals."
"My boyfriend says Im nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what Im doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I cant help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things. Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with Sorry, Ive been working. I just read your message. The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with Dont text me anymore. I dont feel like I am way out of the line. But I cant talk with him if all that he will say is that Im crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?","Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people.You gave examples which strongly suggest this.Quite commonly, a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behavior.Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you, not that youre seeing things incorrectly.One way to check if youre totally misreading him, is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships.If no one else who knows you tells you that youre crazy, then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong.Also, a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion, what to do with your newfound clarity!"
"I want us all to get along, but feel that I am not being respected. Of course I do have some insecurities because he was with his ex for 8 years. He wants to see his step daughter and ex makes it so he has to go there to see her, but she doesnt want me around. She has a boyfriend, but mine fixes their vehicles, goes over once a week and hangs out with the ex and does family things with her. Since he works nights, I only see him parts of FridaySunday and we live together. He wont let me use his phone when I forgot mine, says his ex used to mess with it. I dont think hes cheating, but he will lie about what time he actually left her place to come home or about going over early to be with them. I feel like the other woman. She has tried to mess with holiday plans by restricting when he can see the child. He only dated once person before her, so this could be why. I dont feel he has let go enough. He is a wonderful boyfriend other than this.","How much of your unhappiness with your boyfriends way of handling himself regarding his ex, have you told him?The topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationship.The good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partner.There may not be any bad news, depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the ex.Talking the matters you list, may open a lot of emotion and become sidetracked very easily.A couples therapist, whose focus is on the couple, not either of you as individuals, may be useful to you and your boyfriend so that you are able to complete your discussions without getting lost by the emotions raised."
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.,Your partners obviously very confused when it comes to love. Sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid. They know that its something worth holding on to but most feel they cant handle it and cant meet up to their partners expectations. Your partner loves you but must have fear that keeps standing in his way. It could also mean their afraid of getting hurt or disapointed in the long run. Give your partner comfort and reassurance that they can come to you to confide in you about anything that may be bothering them.
"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. Im very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of hurt and confused?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics. Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations dont go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation."
Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, Id ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly youve lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If youd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then youve found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than need."
"Im in a relationship with my fianc and I currently found out that shes been cheating on me with a coworker. I was very upset none the less. I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So Im willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what Ive done to her and since then I been completely faithful. Im worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I dont know what to do or where to go for advice?","What Makes Love Last? how to build trust and avoid betrayal by John Gottman is a great book for you both to start reading. You may also want to invest some time and energy in couples therapy. It sounds like there is a lack of trust in your relationship, likely a hangover from your beginnings, that would be helpful for you both to work through to truly be able to forgive and move forward."
"We went out had great sex and I was really liking her. Then one day she says we should just be friends, but I cant stop thinking about her. Shes always on mind and I want her back.","It can be really difficult when someone you care about doesnt feel the same about you. The most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way. There is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with you.In the end, if she just wants to be friends then shes probably not the right match for you.Remember, every relationship ends until that last one that doesnt. And that is how its supposed to be"
"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. What advice might you offer?","With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc. Begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode.Then share how you felt at the time of the event. Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt shocked or whatever the feeling was. PERIOD. THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY. Wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing. You can even add, I agree I could have misunderstood it event.... I just know it made me feel uneasy.Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate.Good luck Id love to hear how it goes!"
What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me. Or I couldnt have many friends because of who I am. Its strange I want to be loved but Id hate to be because I always lose.,"As a relationship therapist I work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood.How did you caregivers express or not express love towards you? How did they express or not express love towards one another. These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others.In his bookWired for Love,Stan Tatkin, PsyD writesWe learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone. We learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us. Our self worth and selfesteem also develop because of other people. This could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it, you may have to interview a few to find the right fit thats OK. Maybe youd even want to read that book I linked above. Noticing thispatternis HUGE, its where transformation begins. And now that you have be kind with yourself, it begins there too."
He goes out with her to dinnerbrunchmovies when we are not together we live 2 hours apart.,"Would you have the same desire to meet this friend if she were a he? If you are concerned that their friendship is a substitute for you when you arent present,talk to him. It sounds like you are concerned that he is building an emotional intimacy with her and spending time doing the sort of things with her that youd otherwise be doing with him. Help him understand why this bothers you but try to also be open to allowing him to make friends. Is the issue that he hasnt introduced you? Is there another reason you dont trust their friendship?"
We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room. Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop. We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it. His wife my good friend saw us kiss once and told my husband. I told him a couple of things then and we got over it. A year later she told him a couple of other things. Same story. Its been about 3 years since. They are now divorced and my husband and I have been happy. A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did. I decided to just tell my husband everything. We are trying to work things out. But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it. How can I help him believe me?,The issue at hand here is that youre betrayal broke his trust. In order to repair your relationship you will both need toconfront the infidelity. And both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated. It would be really helpful to do this work with a Gottman or Emotionally Focused Couples Therapist. Gottmans The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along.
He is in his late thirties and I am in my mid twenties. We have been together for about 5 months. I really like him. He says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right. He has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear. I dont know if its worth giving him a second chance.,"Cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship. His fear may be full of information. While its possible to repair relationships after a betrayal its also challenging to do, especially so early in your relationship. I cant tell you if you shouldshouldnt give this relationship a second chance but I will tell you to tune into your own intuition and follow your own fears in doing so, they often are incredibly informative when we dont push them away with denial."
"However, it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself. I have even accused him of having a secret phone. Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose, or is he really talking to himself?","Some people simply talk to themselves as a way of processing information. Have you checked in with your husband about this in a nonaccusatory way? Something like Hey babe or whatever sweet name you typically use, Im so curious what thats all about? Do you notice that you are talking out loud? Chances are its just how he thinks things through and is not at all about trying to make you crazy, its just one of his quirks youll grow to endear. Early married life is a time full of discovering one anothers quirks!"
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see whats amiss. Youre looking for fixeruppers! When you meet these men they need you. And youre filled by fixing them.

"My girlfriends grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked whats up. She says she cant connect with anyone and that its not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now Im very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I dont know. It just feels like something is really off.","Grief has a huge impact on us and everyones reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track."
Im currently dating someone else and I really like him. But I love and miss my ex so much. What do I do?,"Finding the right person is a tricky thing to do. Why did you and your ex break up 3 months ago? In relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself. Sometimes you may enjoy that reflection, other times it may not feel so good. Im not sure where you are in your life and relationships and what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life. But Im not simply talking in the moment desire, Im referring to the direction you want your life to go. If one of these guys was to support you...who would help you reach your dreams? And who would you enjoy spending time with? Its complicated and no one can answer the what to do question but you. Slow down. Tune into your heart. Listen."
We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together. I need some help to save our family.,"Hello, I do not live in the California area. However, perhaps I could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling. First, I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover livein partners, as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group. If you find there are no such groups in your area, there are anonymous, support groups online. Here is one such site"
I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. How do I figure out what triggers me to do this? And how do I help overcome this problem? I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.,"Well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had, you want to notice that you have triggers. Thats huge. Really.I find that when people lie, its most often as a defense mechanism. Which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe. What exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you.It could really help to explore this with therapist, perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers!"
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them.Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that youve spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships."
"Hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks Im obsessed when Im not at all. I give him his space and I make sure hes okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, its kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. Hes a great guy! I just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me. Hes starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point Ill do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","Im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear, but Id suggest giving him space. Ooph, thats a tough one, right?! I know. But heres the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship. Its the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? Thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now."
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?,"Being able to accept your partners influence is a key relationship skill. And its very two sided. Chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you, they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either. The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence. Play with it."
I havent uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now Im over it and dont know how to approach the situation?,"In any relationship, it is important to be able to say Im sorry because it shows vulnerability and openness. I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated. Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hearunderstand what your partner is trying to convey."
Ive been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason I keep getting with men that I let emotionally abused me. How can I stop it? I know the mistakes that Ive made in my life. Im having a really hard time getting back on my feet. Can you help me please?,"I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solution.Dont misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed.First, go and buy the book Boundaries Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him I dont need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes. She stuck to that, too. He didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life.These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You cant change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become."
"I have been with a guy for 4 years, hes a great guy and we also have a son together. The problem is that Im in love with a guy that Ive been talking to for about 2 years but Ive never met him in person. Honestly Im bored with the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy, I dont know how to tell him that. What should I do?","Hi there. Wow, this sounds like a sticky situation however, Im here to help guide you through this decision.First and foremost, you must ask yourself, if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child. Its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless, if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do. Right? Well, not entirely. Although, staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right, in fact, it hurts the child in the long run. If you are not love with your partner, you will show distance, unhappiness, sadness, possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult, you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just remember, what you do, your child will model.Secondly, do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However, being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly, that sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship, they often seek out what they need. If you decide to pursue the second relationship, I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days.Finally, I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not. You should ask yourself, if you were in love with your childs father first off. If you were, you would have never sought after love. I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation. Take care of yourself!"
"I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. At first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, wed break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times. Weve also had two beautiful baby girls during this time. Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I dont know how to please a man, when I work parttime, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. Sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet. In addition, I have 2 boys and he has 1 son. I feel somewhere I have lost something. Its not that I dont care, I truly love this guy, but Im just tired of being the one who is always being judged. Please, I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because I really need to speak to someone.","I dont think youve lost something, I think youve found something your breaking point, and its about time. Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him. Obviously, he has his own issues, but I want to address yours. I agree you need to talk to someone. The fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough, etc., tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better. You do! You may truly love this guy, but based on his behaviors, he does not love you, not in the way you deserve. And although you may want to believe he can change, he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to, so you need to do what is best for you and your children. What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way? Would you want your sons to treat women this way? Thats what youre teaching your children when they see this.Like I said, I agree that you should talk to someone. You can ask your boyfriend to go too, but my guess is he wont. Even if he does, you should still see someone individually to work on YOU. I understand its not easy to just kick him out, especially since you have children together, but a counselor can help you talk through all the details whilehelping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth."
"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed. Thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So thats what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasnt an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. Ive treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now Im losing my family and my mind. I dont know what to do.","I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own."
"After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.","What most people dont know is that sexual preferences can be fluid, meaning our sexual orientation is not as fixed as most people believe. Women in particular tend to be more fluid in their desire to express and experience sex. It is not uncommon for heterosexual women in their midlife to explore new sexual appetites. That said, men tend to be more rigid in their orientations particularly if they are hetero while gay men tend to be more fluid. So if your distress is over your new interests I would tell you, you are not alone and not abnormal. Since you have started exploring, enjoy and consider seeing a therapist to help you navigate your feelings around this new sexual life! Warm wishes."
"Im a girl, and I cant tell whether Im bisexual or gay. I like girls a little more than boys, but I dont really know.","I would ask you, do you feel like you need to come up with a label? Is there something about identifying as one or the other that would be helpful for you? From what current science has told us about sexual orientation, its a spectrum. There are people on the spectrum who are clearly gay, or clearly heterosexual, and then there is everyone in between, which includes being bisexual which I guess in the spectrum would be smack in the middle?It may be too early for you to identify as any one thing on that spectrum as you say, but I dont really know, or maybe as you move through life you just wont identify as any one thing, and thats totally okay. The most important thing, in my professional opinion, is to accept yourself, fully, for whatever it is that you are. The second most important thing, in my professional opinion too, is to be honest with yourself and your partners about however you do identify your sexual orientation."
What should I do when we see each other?,I am so sorry this happened. Sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful. I might suggest depending on your relationship reaching out to your sister and discussing this or setting boundary that you dont want to discuss your private life. I might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal.
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I dont know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"Hi, as an affirming gender therapist I like to let people know that like sexuality, gender is a spectrum too. Its possible to look like a girl and feel more like a boy, just as its possible to feel halfway between a boy and a girl, or anywhere else on a horizontal line with two points between it. Some people use different pronouns or words to express their gender and thats okay. Its up to you to find out what is most comfortable."
"Ive been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. Ive never thought about men until a week ago. Im very upset and depressed about this. Its not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that Im not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. Im scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!"
"I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other womens clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it. I enjoy it very much. I have had a pantyhosestocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young. I have no history of sexual abuse growing up. I am currently single.","Let yourself enjoy crossdressing!What sounds in your way are whatever beliefs you gre up hearing, see and absorb currently.Concentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a nonharming way.Maybe if you branch out your interest by finding other people who enjoy crossdressing as much as you do.With any interest or activity, social interaction supports it."
I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I dont know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.,Wonderful! I am so excited for you. What a huge decision. I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically. I would start with two things 1 Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2 find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized. They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well. Google is a wonderful way to find these resources. I wish you well. Thanks for writing!
"In middle school and high school, my friends and family thought I was gay. I tried telling them, but they wouldnt believe me. It almost feels like they wanted me to be. Now Im actually starting to believe them. I know I wasnt back then, and now Im not sure anymore.","I agree with Amy. We get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we wantat a pretty early age. The truth is, our sexuality canchange and grow in directions we never imagined. I may be wrong, but I am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay. That this is something you didnt like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true. Thiswould certainly beunderstandable. Your sexuality is YOURS and yours alone. It can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are. And it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself. The truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation. It may help to think about what qualities you find attractive. What kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to? Someone smart? Funny? Loves dogs? If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex, but maybe not. At least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire. Another idea is to chat with a counselor, if you are interested. Preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy. Be well and be you..Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"Im a guy. If I dont like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean Im gay?","It doesnt sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone. It could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive, or that you are asexual essentially not oriented toward anyone. I would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel!"
"Im transgender, I know I am, but Ive only told a few friends. I know I cant tell my family because of previous conversations weve had. They just wouldnt accept it. My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hi. It can be difficult to handle such a transition on your own. I work with clients to understand their needs and wants. This can involve how to communicate effectively with friends, family, and other loved ones or, learning how to have selfacceptance. I strongly recommend speaking with a licensed clinician one on one to help facilitate the change you are looking for."
"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watchingreading about gay or lesbian couples. Ive also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello! Thank you for your question. Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself! I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.
"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I dont get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. Im too ashamed to tell anyone.","Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had thesefeelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knewabout yourself. My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that thisstarted is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make theconnection. I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. Itis really hard to say since I dont know you, how old you are, etc. But, I willshare you with you some thoughts. Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that reallysurprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction tothe thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuffit, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, its usually not. Its like telling you not to think of pink elephants. Iwould be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing,sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosityand without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelingsabout it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolutionabout what is going on. One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety aboutyour thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, butanother possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality andgender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believethat it is second possibility. And that is okay. You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see acounselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I wouldsuggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You canusually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What isimportant is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you areexperiencing. I wish you well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"Im a teenage girl. I dont know if Im straight, bisexual, or gay. Ive been straight all my life, but a sudden rush of questions have come over me, and I dont know anymore.","Being open minded about the type of sexual connection which feels true and real, is a solid starting point.Having questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexuality.Write one or two of your questions if youd like a more specific focus to your general search about your sexual preference."
Ive recently thought that i could be transgender but Ive never had the mind of a girl.,"Hello Frostproof,Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different. This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues. From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system. While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining. Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification, explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you! There are many options for you to find a therapist and etherapy is also an option. You can try Breakthrough an online service. Here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful.

I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think Im like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I dont care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.,"I understand that gender andor sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate, although in todays time I think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from society.I am unsure how old you are. If you are a child or teenager, this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. A lot of people, unfortunately, do not, and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time. By this I mean a sex change. Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly. Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis. Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes. Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice. Maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could do.See if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area. PFLAG stands for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. They are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay, but also transgendered and asexual.I wish you all the best in your identity crisis. It would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time. Find a professional that can help, especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself."
I cant understand what I pay attention to.,"One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate. Youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of selfreminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work."
Im a teenager and Ive been sneaking out of my house at night for a year now. Ive been caught several times. I want to stop doing this but I dont know where to start. How do I stop?,"Ive talked to many teens who frequently sneak out. The question I always ask them is, What are you getting from sneaking out that you arent getting at home? Many teens answer they are hooking up, using substances, and engaging in other risky behaviors. As uncomfortable as it might be, I encourage you to talk with your parents or guardians about the reasons why you are sneaking out. What are you getting out there that you arent getting at home? A good family counselor can help sort through those issues. Good luck!"
I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD. Can counseling help me to get over it?,"Counseling can be very effective for OCD. In particularly, a kind of therapy called Exposure Response Ritual Prevention Therapy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of OCD. What this is, is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checkingcleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that OCD given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life. Research has shown that this kind of therapy may even be more effective for OCD than medication,"
"Im a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings. My mood will be really high and Ill think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesnt work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out. Can you explain whats going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things dont work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesnt work out. This said, youre coming to CounselChat and so Im guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustrationmood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a persons mood and energy might fly so high mania that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted note there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis. Wish you well!"
"For the past four weeks, Ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. Theyre not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.","Hearing voices can be a very upsetting experience to have. I want you to know that a lot of people will hear a voice at some point in their lives and that there are many things that cause voices. Oftentimes, significant stress can offset us to have symptoms like this. There also mental and physical health conditions that can do the same. I strongly encourage you to seek out help from both a doctor and a counselor to help you piece together exactly what is causing your voices. I Once youve got that down, youll know what to work on. In the meantime, here are some strategies to cope with voices1. Lower your stress levels Oftentimes stress makes voices worse. What can you do to lower your stress?2. Get enough Sleep Like stress, sleep deprivation is an awful trigger for hearing voices3. Listen to Music Music can help you focus on another sound4. Wear headphone or Earplugs5. Use Your Own Voice If the voices are saying harsh things to you, it can be tempting to talk back and thats okay if you do. However, you cn also use your own voice through singing, whistling, or the like, which can help drown out the voices6. Remind Yourself that What the Voices Say is Not True Sometimes it Helps to Write it Out7. Draw the Voice or Give it a Name This can make it less scary and help get it outside of you8. Keep Track of When You Hear Voices to Identify Triggers These are situations you can avoid while these are so distressful for you9. Be Kind to Yourself When a Voice is Being Cruel to You it is especially important to be kind to yourself10. Remember that while hearing voices can be disturbing that it is a common experience and something that many people recover from."
My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one. I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.,"I do not think there is such a thing as a psychotic seizure, however, there is something called a pseduoseizure or psychogenic nonepileptic seizure. Basically, this is when a person shows signs of a fullon seizure such as falling and convulsing but they are not producing brain waves consistent with a seizure. Psedoseizures tend to be brought on by high stress, emotional challenges, and trauma history. You can learn more here,Still, the best way to now what your doctor meant would be to ask them!"
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I cant get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?","Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddhas Brain, he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I dont have time to go into all of that in this response. So, its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought."
"Im a teenager, and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if Im worried or upset. She gives me advice and comforts me and tells me itll be okay. Ive given her a name Solace and created a personality for her thats like a comforting motherly figure. I know its just my own advice and my own thoughts, but its just that Im thinking of them through a voice other than my own. I do this because I know I never really listen to my own advice, and I thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out, through this imaginary friend. Is this normal? Could it develop into a separate personality with time if I continue a mentality that she is her own person?","Hi, Im Amelia! You know, it does sounds like you have imagined a motherly comfort figure for yourself. Sometimes, when I have a person in my office that is very selfcritical, I have himher speak to his or herself as though heshe were speaking to a loved one. Isnt it sad that we speak to others more lovingly than we do ourselves?If you have not received empathy, nurturing, or comfort from a caregiver, it is hard to internalize empathy, nurture or comfort from the inside. There is a saying that We have been hurt in relationships and we can heal in relationships. Healing and growth are best provided in the context of healthy relationship.How about going the next step and finding a compassionate therapist or loving mentor that could actually provide you with the comfort that you need. You deserve to be seen, heard, noticed, and valued. I am wishing my very best to you!"
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further."
People always judge others so rudely.,"I agree with you and this is emotionally painful to watch or be on the receiving side.Depending on who is the person doing this and your relationship to them, it is possible to kindly point out that the person may unnecessarily hurt someones feelings.If you express your thoughts and give your guidance, then whatever the person does afterwards, you have the peace of knowing you tried to redirect this behavior."
"Ive developed a really intense and unexpected attraction to An actress after seeing her in a ballet uniform while guest starring on a television show. I try, but I cant get her out of my mind. What should I do?","Why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someone.Attraction based on physicality is normal. As long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel, and so long as your attraction isnt stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work, to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people, then eventually it will lose its power on you."
I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. How can I fix my underlying issues?,"Hi there. Its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right?What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and notsopositive. Then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, Im too pushy, can be rewritten as, Im assertive and I go after what I want. It can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if thats not an option for you right now, there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there. Youve already taken the first step, so keep moving forward."
"I know Im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make. I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just cant seem to even though I really want to. Why cant I force myself to change?","Hello, and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, I want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help.

"I dont feel like myself anymore. For example, I could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving. I feel like Im watching my life be lived by someone else.","You may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization. People with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies, feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance, or may not recognize their image in the mirror. Dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic. I would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own. On my website, I have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful. Best of luck to you."
I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife. Im not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me. Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I dont know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?,"The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you. Im glad you have awareness and Im glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain. Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you. It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong. It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships."
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. Thereve even been splitseconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe."
"She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it. She has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home, and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home. We do not understand what is going on, and it is driving us crazy.","There are many possible answers here. It could be that she misses friends, that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable, or dozens of other things. Will she talk about it when shes not mad? You mentioned that she has an attachment issue. It could also be that she was attached to the house. Its not the same as being attached to a person, but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot."
"My daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying calm down when she dropped her phone. Within seconds, the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb, saying horrifically unspeakable things, and her calling the cops on me. She seems unable to stop herself at times.","Bipolar disorder has a lot of different components. If this is a onetime event, it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to calm down may have made her feel as though you werent understanding what she was saying. Bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression. When this is coupled with intense anger and acting or speaking without thinking, these can be part of bipolar disorder, but that wouldnt be the whole picture of what bipolar disorder would look like. It may be helpful to track differences that you notice in your daughters mood and any patterns related to the times of day or what seems to lead her to be upset. Patterns are very helpful in figuring out what is happening."
"Ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they dont have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. Im not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier."
"Ive felt this way for two years. I feel so much better now then I did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.","Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a rollercoaster, here it is, then its gone not to return for quite some time, like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about. Hope this helps,C"
"Its been like a couple of years that Ive been feeling like this. I dont want to selfdiagnose, but I get so sad and cry and then I feel better. But then I get upset with people so quickly, and I hurt their feelings. Its this constant rollercoaster, and its hard.","Hello, and thank you for your question. Bipolar disorder isgenerallycharacterized by extreme changes in mood, ranging from mania highs to depression lows. There are different types however, so here is awebsite thatgives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider ora counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management.

A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make.The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesnt mean that things cant get better. There is currently no cure for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
I just need to know if Im really crazy or not.,"Do an internet research on psychosis symptoms and see if you have several of the symptoms. If you do, seek a medical evaluation from your primary care physician. There are great medications and psychotherapy that can help you live your life to the fullest. There a many people who are diagnosed with psychosis and living a productive life."
"I start to think of an issue that doesnt even matter or something bad that happened years ago. Then, I cry, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, and throw things. In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody. I have an awful fear of people leaving me which normally ends up happening and I feel like Im too clingy.","There is a reason you are having breakdowns.I cant agree that they happen forno reason at all. Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past, uncover hurtful experiences, orrecognize something that would be extremely pain. However, if you dont find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you mayconfront,the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse. There is a light at the end of the road but you needsome help to find the right road to get on so you can see it."
"I have an exboyfriend who just lies about everything. He is super lazy. He lies to everyone that he has a good job, builds trust, and then start borrowing moneyand large amounts too. It has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends. He is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story, borrow money, then disappear. He refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends. I used to think his lying was due to his drug habit, but now Im hearing from other exfriends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life. He would borrow anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 from everyone and it would all disappear. Hes in debt with bills. He doesnt gamble, but he spends his money on random stuff. Although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money, he seems to be a good person. Hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what. My brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother. He takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him. He drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being. Is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there?","It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out. You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him, and this is true of everyone to one degree or another. One question that I would have for you is, are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands? Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you, or would you like them to be different? Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist. Another question I would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior? Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him."
"I noticed lately that Ive been thinking a lot about death. I dont want to die, and Im not suicidal. I just think about what would happen if I died or if someone I loved died. I imagine how sad everyone I know would be. I know it isnt worth it, and I definitely want to live and have a future. I just think about it. When Im driving, I sometimes imagine what would happen if I just let go of the wheel and kept going.","Ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving, youll end up quite seriously hurt, at the very least. It is fine to play in your mind with what ifs. People who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions.If you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you, and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things, then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on death.Since you wonder about being missed if you die, it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in you.Play around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their lives.This may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others."
"I was never like this. Recently this year my first year of high school, I started getting emotional for no reason.","Hello Vancouver, Its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes. The small thing is a trigger, and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling. Youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it. Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke. If theres anger there, look underneath that. Is it powerlessness, worthlessness, hurt, shame...? Then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced TOO much of that feeling. As a child, maybe, but not necessarily.Thats the first step, and combined with empathy, compassion and selfesteem, youre starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner. A good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily. I wish you the best."
"I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All Im ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an alltime low in my life, and Im not even that old. Ive always been a straightA student, but now Im getting Cs and Fs, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. Its not even like the work is hard.","Possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problem.Since you describe your laziness as an observable quality, I assume youve not always felt or handled yourself this way.Quite possibly and more likely, the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvements.One suggestion is to see if there is any purpose to what youre doing in all the areas in which you see yourself acting from laziness.If youre not able to notice any good purpose, then you may be mistaking laziness for a significant amount of stress in your life.Stress can be opened and understood. If stress is what underlies what appears as laziness, then you define the contributors to your stress.Not feeling enough support in your life, financial uncertainty, arguments w people who are close in your life, feeling misunderstood overall or by particular people, all are possibilities.Good luck in learning more about who you are!"
"I never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but Im concerned.","Hi Houston, The fact that youre concerned says a lot. If I was your therapist Id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life. Youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage? to your body, and its likely youre trying to express something...pain maybe? A therapist can help you to explore whats going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way. Good luck!"
"I feel that I am struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and it is making my daytoday life extremely difficult.","It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of distress and youre wondering if it may meet a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder. There are a few different types of Bipolar diagnoses in the DSM diagnositc and statistical manual and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional. You can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteria.One question that I would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out that you meet the criteria for such a diagnosis? It sounds like whether or not you do, you are suffering and working with a therapist may help you get into a better place."
"For some reason, I look at my phone, and in no time, five hours has passed. During those five hours, Im playing games and trying to find out how to make my phone fun to use so I dont feel like I wasted my time trying to improve my phones performance in my life.","Start by spending small amounts of time with your own thoughts and feelings.Always being focused on what a phone offers keeps people at a distance from knowing themselves.As long as you make time to spend in an activity which is not interactive the way a phone is, and instead depends only upon your actions, you will be investing time and energy into your own life.Whether by consciously considering your own interests, or doing housecleaning or chores, by devoting yourself to areas which you decide to be involved in, you will increase your knowledge of your own interests.Then, to not be so involved with your phone will be natural and easy."
"This is my recovery, and I dont feel that it is okay for them to ask this. They told me it is policy due to the fact that I may run into a peer there. I am a peer counselor in the small community that I grew up in. I am in recovery myself. I was asked to come work for this organization after I was two years sober I was in treatment in this organization. I work with mental health peers and run life skill groups. I dont work with substance peers.","You definitely want to make sure not to inadvertently create an inappropriate dual relationship with a client.In fact, it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same 12 step group is professional misconduct.You might want to consider attending a 12 step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in. Another option would be to look for oneonone or small group recovery support."
"I have a relative who is in his twenties. He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again. No one informed family that he was using drugs again. He subsequently overdosed and was found dead. Is their accountability of counselors, therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed? Is there a legal case for failing to report?","Im so sorry to hear of your loss. This sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family. Since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws, I would suggest talking with a local attorney. That being said, I see two competing issues here. On the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owedto your relative. On the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm. Generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapses.A local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation."
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation?,"This sounds like a potentially serious situation. The most important thing is to make sure the child is safe. If you suspect that a child is or has been harmed, I would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to Child Protective Services. If you dont think that a child is in danger, you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board."
They discontinued treatment for no apparent reason after they thought to diagnose me with schizophrenia.,"The general rule against medical abandonmentsays thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it, they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher ability.In this case, if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia, they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment. If you havent already done so, Id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral."
"I had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation. Now, she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic which takes my insurance, which is also where I get my psychiatric services. There is a strict 48 hour cancellation policy, and my appointments are at 300 on Tuesday. I called to cancel at 430 the previous Friday. I was late, so we contacted my doctor to tell her that I would be out of town. She said I could do a phone in session. The thing is we do double sessions.","My recommendation would be to try to talk to your therapist about this from your description, it sounds like you have a legitimate explanation for missing your scheduled session.Maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you.If she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you, she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist."
"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasnt called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?","Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients. This is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller. In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards. For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherrys advice. If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit."
"I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did. I just found out that my mom cant afford a therapist for me.","It can be difficult to get counseling if you dont feel supported by family members. There might be a few options. If you are in school, Id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse. They often will be able to help you access freeor affordablecounseling resources in your community. In addition, depending on where you live, its also often possible to call 211 for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your area.Id encourage you not to give up. You are on the right track."
"I have major depression, severe, PTSD, anxiety disorder, and personality disorder. I had an appointment with my doctor. I was very upset, and I shared with him about that particular drug.","Your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist especially if your doctor is concerned about your safety.It was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on. I know that must have been difficult to talk about with him. By having that conversation, you are helpingyour primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health."
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated1 Client has met therapy goals2 Client is not progressing3 Therapist is not a good fit for clientIn order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made, the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping, what isnt, and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals. When a client has met their goals, that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention.When a client is not progressing, and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail, than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client. In these circumstances, referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea."
"My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I dont know what to do.","Im sorry to hear that this hashappened.Counselors are legallyand ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests.In addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to take advantage ofa client financially.A counselor borrowing money from a client even if the counselorpays it back wouldusually be considered to be taking advantage of the client.There are a few options you have at this point ifyou cant or dont want to continue to try to contact him directly. You can file a complaint with your states regulatory board and let themknow what has happened.An investigator will then look into the situation for you. Another option would be for you to find a different counsleor who can provide you with an independent and netural point of view to help you figure out how you want to handle this situation."
I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"Its a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing.Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist.There are also other similar professions, including counseling that dont require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school.If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to. Heres a link to the NJ APA chapter"
"I am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States. I faced a cultural shock, and I was so depressed when I arrived here. My counselor in the university was my savior. He helped me a great deal. Now I am going back to my country for a vacation. I was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it, and I remembered that he likes wine. My country is known for that. Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas?","This is a great question.In general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients.There are some exceptions to this general rule including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift giving.It might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings. You could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriate.In the end, I know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you."
"I have an eating disorder of binging. Ive had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.","It can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you need.My recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel. Specifically tell Your counselor that you dont seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would like.If this doesnt help, then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you."
Im worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status. Im just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone.,"Having this kind of conversation with a doctor can feel difficult. But remember, you are the expert on you. Any good medical professional will recognize that.You are absolutely right to think about the importance of being your own health care advocate. Generally, the best approach is simply to be honest. Let your doctor know what you are concerned about and tell your doctor what you think might help. If there is a specific issue that youd like to address in counseling, let you doctor know about it. And dont hesitate to directly ask for a referral.I know this may all feel a little overwhelming. It might help to bring a family member or significantother with you to provide support when you talk to your doctor. Its great that youve already taken this first step to reach out. Youre on the right track."
I need help dealing with stress. How can I handle it all and feel less stressed out?,"In case you feel some relief to know youre feeling the tone of our times.We live with crumbling of our values which then gives rise to insecurity everywhere. If someone doesnt know what their values are then its difficult to do anything, and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptions.Youre more normal for noticing and feeling stressed than if you imagine life felt fine the way it is!One road to take is to accept that there are no clear roads forward. This means to change long term goals into shorter ones.Also, in general the more focused you can be as to your particular wishes, motivations, interests, and people about whom you care, the greater will be your sense of confidence that your personal world is as secure as it can be for right now.And, it helps too to know that nothing lasts forever, eventually all of what is up in the air will start to land in a much more clear way."
I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Something different works for each of us.There are the outward answers of selfpampering and making your home and work environment as pleasant as possible.A deeper level way to decrease stress is through exercise or alternative practices like yoga or tai chi.If the stress is more deeply rooted than temporarily feeling irritated for a few days, then give yourself some time to reflect and clarify what the meaning of the stress is to you.Selfunderstanding and appreciating your efforts to know yourself may decrease stress because youll be more focused and attentive to who you are. This will influence you overall to make good decisions for yourself and these will naturally be ones which decrease stress as much as possible."
"Im in my late 20s. I have two jobs right now, Im in school, and I feel like I just have a lot under my belt right now. I get stressed out really easily. I tend to worry and overthink. Im just worried about money and everything.","A good start is to pay attention to some basic issues sleep, nutrition, exercise and socially supportive relationships. A great car on an empty tank will not get you very far."
"Is it a type of fetish, or is it normal?",Maybe it is a way to secretly satisfy your own wish to be or to live life gay.
"I am a young adult, and I was sexually assaulted by an older man when I was a teenager which has really intensified the guiltshame. However, Ive been attracted to much older men since I was even younger than that.","Sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distant.If you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this, then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within you.It is ok to like older men.Just be sure youre not idealizing them, or anyone else.Because regardless of age, a relationship is based on who the two people really are, not how wed like imagining them."
"I have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that I talk to nowadays. I keep imagining having sex with them. I have never had sex before, nor have I had a boyfriend. I feel lonely and empty. I feel like my body is not okay, and I am missing something. I talk to so many boys in school, and I always fantasize about half of them. I want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time, I am busy thinking about sex.","Hi Montreal, Im glad you wrote. What youre experiencing is normal. Were sexual beings. We have a builtin desire to connect sexually with others, because it feels good, to keep procreation going, and mostly to connect with other people, because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable. Sexual desire is a healthy part of you. Maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it? It sounds like youre beginning to explore yourself sexually, and thats okay.At your young age, you also have another innate burning desire, and that is to know yourself. I see both of these desires burning and competing in you. Its a bit of a crazy time...you want to connect with others but youre not sure who you are or what you want from them. You want to know yourself but you cant learn about yourself in a vacuum.Its okay to trust your instincts. Its okay to connect sexually with others, as long as youre preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries. But even as I write this, I think maybe Im being controlling and overprotective of you its your body and youre in charge of what happens to it! But I do want you to be safe...whatever that means to you. Maybe talk to someone you trust.With each encounter you have with other people sexual or not, you will learn more about yourself and what you want, both sexually and just in relationship or friendship. You will develop a sense of who you are.Have you tried to get to know yourself sexually? This is a super place to start, and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others. When you explore your own body, what feels good? What brings you to orgasm?I wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely."
"Back in high school, my friend and I used to masturbate around each other. I hate even talking about it now because its so weird. We didnt even realize how messed up it was at the time. One time, it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other. It wasnt supposed to be a gay thing, but it sure sounds like it now that I talk about it. I pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again. Im having a lot of trouble.","Writing about your high school masturbation times with your friend, is itself a form of acknowledging the full picture of who you are. You are doing well to reflect on your actions in the truthful way you are doing.Also positive is that you have perspective, that at your age and social maturity, you were innocently doing something that in adult terms, would be considered in a negative way.Maybe through your more mature minds eye of today, you can feel some compassion and understanding for your high school self. This way your sense of selfjudgment may start to dissolve a little bit more."
"These jokes are made about everything. They seem to have the need to say something funny about everything. Its not funny, just awkward.","I agree, it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all. And, if a person only jokes, then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer, this can also be quite tedious.Realize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression. You could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave."
"My best friend and I were pranking her friend, and I told her to tell him that she likes him. She said no, but I forced her. After she told him, he told her that he likes her too. Their friendship is ruined because of me. She wont forgive me, and I feel really guilty. I feel like crying.","In order for your friend to forgive you shed need to trust you understand the damage you introduced into her relationship with her friend.Its possible if you offer your friend expressions of your empathy toward her over an extended time, possibly shell forgive you.Youre certainly learning relationship lessons on how to treat people and the effect of betraying another person, which will last forever.Maybe this was meant to be the outcome."
"I was mentored by this guy for a few years spiritually. It was okay at times, but other times, it was just weird. I try not to think about it too much, but a lot of manipulation and lying happened, yet no one else really believed me when I told them. Its like hes two different people, and no one else really sees that side of him. I was blamed for a lot of our troubles, and now we dont really talk much. Im worried because hes in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything. They just think Im attacking his character. How do I know for sure?","You may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understood.Just Google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these roles.Theoretically, is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths? Well, yes. And, I consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people. Being able to recognize social dynamics, is a strength that you have.Psychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopaths.I agree with you about not being able to change peoples minds who are attached to this persons interactions.The only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity, and you have evidence of this, that you contact relevant authorities.No one is allowed to break laws, including psychopaths."
"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they wont answer me. Could it be that there is something they dont like about me? I dont understand why they wont answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the nonresponse has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts? This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write, imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!"
"She mostly targets me on social media. The bullying used to be much worse, but it is still going on. The comments are so vague, but I know that they are meant for me. Even when I confront her, she messages me short phrases to try to get in my head. If I try to fight back, she will ruin me.","Sorry to hear of your problem situation. Feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettling.Stop having contact with the person.Bullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someone.Bullies do not have the same dynamics as everyone else.No one can convince or persuade or talk a bully out of their behavior.The best protection for yourself, assuming you are not being physically threatened by the person, is to close contact with them.This does not take away any of the disappointment or sadness of wishing for a better relationship with the person.Until the bully wants to interact differently with others, only harm can result from contact with them.Step one is to stop the bleeding, then to assess and learn to live with not having the person in your life."
Its really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who dont put any effort into nourishing our relationship.,"One thing I would ask is why are you still hanging with those friends? A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is onesided, it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate. Never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.Hope this helps, C"
Im having problems shutting them out and putting up walls.,"It sounds like you would like to let other people get close to you and at the same time you are finding yourself compelled to keep people at a distance. Often times, when we have difficulty trusting others, it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down. Such fears may be rooted in past experiences in relationships in which we were hurt and or disappointed. In working with a therapist, you can gain insight into what is underneath your compulsion to put walls around yourself and develop ways to form authentic, lasting, satisfying relationships with others."
"Im having a quinceaera, and the girls dont like their dresses. They never told me, and now its a week away. I dont know what to do.","How did you find out that the girls arent happy with their dresses?Did you hear this directly from one of them or is this third hand information that someone else told you about one of the girls in your party?The answer matters because gossiping instead of directly telling you about a problem, is a problem in itself.I suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dresses.One topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party. Are they coming because they like one another and wearing a dress in which the girl is happy, is only one way of having fun together?You may learn a great deal as to the difference in values about a quinceaa among you and your friends.I hope youll have a fun party!"
I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,"Staying present is an attitude most of us aspireto, and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first. Im here to tell youthat living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately,the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox! But there are plenty ofother skills that we are not born with walking on stilts, riding a bike,swimming, and driving a car are good examples. You cant learn them by reading aboutthem.Having said that, I can recommend two books onthe subject Eckhart Tolles The Power ofNow and David Richos When the Pastis Present. Richo asks that we dont beat ourselves up about dwelling onpast events. This is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinishedbusiness. But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives, we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits us.He offers three helpful steps to making any important lifechangeStep One Hold in awareness the behavior,belief, attitude, or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how youwant to be different. Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffing.Step Two Live as if you havealready made the change. This is hard and takes courage, but you can do it.Ride that bikeeven if for a foot or two.Step Three Be persistent.Practice, practice, practice.Just as twoyearolds are able to walkconfidently after hundreds of hours of practice, youll be able to stay in thehere and now as long as you want after trying and failing many, many times."
"In this argument my friends are all against me so Im wondering if Im exaggerating my feelings. I feel like Im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim, when in reality Im the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends. Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship?","Conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in everyone of our relationships.What Im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself. Am I right? If you arent validating yourself, no one else will be able to either. Try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you, this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing. And then if you are still feeling vulnerable, share that too..."
Theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. Im tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning.Inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them.On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!"
"Ive been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. I havent been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years. How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help?","Thats a very difficult situation that you are in. But you are not alone. I have several schoolaged clients who find little to no assistance from their teachers at their schools regarding bullying.There are a few options that are available to you to help deal with being bullied at school. One option that I would suggest is for you to talk to your support network. Friends and family can sometimes be good sources of support. Another option would be to speak with us about your counselor, if you have one. And third, there are some excellent online sources of support regarding the bullying at school www.stopbullying.org."
I nanny a three year old. When he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him. If I am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him. He screams that he wants his mom or dad they work from home. The rest of the day he loves me. But not in the mornings. What can I do?,"It doesnt sound like he hates you, just misses mom and dad in the mornings. You could validate his feelings by saying something like I know you want to see mom and dad right now, but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it. This could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice. If possible, it may also be helpful if you could create a routine in which he stops by mom and dad to say good morning. If this is routine, he will come to understand that he will be able to see mom and dad for a minute and not become anxious about seeing them."
I need to get on base to see my doctor. My ID card was in my wallet which was stolen. Im unable to reach my husband at this time. He is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor. Is there anything I can do?,You should be able to get a replacement ID card either from the Personnel Office on your local base the actual name of this office will vary depending on which branch of the military it is. You may also be required to go to the Military Police or Security office on base to report the loss of your old ID card.
"How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have? What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? Ive read about this online, but Id like to understand this from a therapists point of view.","This is a great question, and I am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach. When I am determining what type of personality a client has, I take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others. Determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and building rapport. After taking time to get to know them, and learning about their view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pickup on more specific personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. Clinicians, including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent, which indicate a type of personality. For example, if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning, and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the type A personality.In addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the DSM5 ICD10."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I dont want. Things like you arent worth anything. I know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","I think we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything. Sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame. The most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality. I dont feel worth anything, but I know what I do is important, I know who I am matters to others. I know I am loved and cared about.When you find yourself having these thoughts, stop, take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what youre thinking."
"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least. I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","Sometimes its helps to have a name for a problem it can make you feel less alone as in, oh theres a name for this and other people have this experience too. On the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now I have a special problem that has a special name, and thats an important part of who I am.Bottom line, whether its a disorder or not, you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings. You might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy just like the volume dial or button on the tv that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel whats going on but its not so loud. You can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being, letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far. This is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability. Just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else, your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted."
How do you know you have the right therapist for you? How would I know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?,"Finding the right therapist for you is very important and can sometimes be tricky. It can sometimes take a number of sessions to get a good sense of whether you and your therapist are the right fit. The first couple of sessions are generally spent on gathering information, formulating a plan of treatment, and building the clienttherapist relationship. The clienttherapist relationship will be very different from other relationships you have experienced. You will know you have found the right therapist when you notice there is agood rapport between the two of you. You will get a sense that the therapist gets you and understands the issues being presented. If you feel that you can trust your therapist and feel comfortable opening up and providing feedback during your sessions then you know it is a good fit.In terms of how to train your therapist how to give you what you need from treatment the therapeutic relationship is collaborative so the twoof you will be working together as a team. During your sessions,the goal is for you to feel comfortable giving feedback about what is working and what is not working in your sessions. When you express your needs to your therapist then the two of you will discuss the best ways to get those needs met in order to maximize the effectiveness of your sessions."
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Its more than just normal, its expected! Quite honestly, there are a very few days where at least one client hasnt cried during therapy throughout the day.IJP"
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have?,"1 An awareness of their own incompetence and inexperience with events in your life2 An awareness of how the body, mind, emotions, spirit, and others all intertwine and activate one another3 How to work to use these connections to have you improve your experience...Oh yeah, and theres some listening in there, as well"
What are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client?,"Dang right! Heh heh, and correct me if Im wrong... and, if we are truly professionals, we should be able to handle even the most bumptious of folks, now shouldnt we? Its like a mechanic who knows his way around every inch of an engine... hell know what to do... heh heh heh..."
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Yes, Counseling provides an area for people to speak to an unbiased professional about their concerns to address their unique needs. While length of time varies, counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions. Counseling provide a safe, nonjudgmental, empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service"
How does a person start the counseling process?,"Hello,There are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process, however they all start with picking up the phone. Its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling, but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief.My recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment. Listening to how they converse, use their tone and inflection, may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away. You may also discover, rather quickly, that this therapist is not the right match for you.Regardless of how you go about it, I like to remind all people who call, email, text or walkin, therapists are a bit like pizzas if you dont like the toppings, send it back! There are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy take the time to pick one that suits you."
"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","For me, I want a client to feel like I understand what brings them to seek help from me. So I might explore both their present circumstances, as well as their history, and try to start making some connections between the two, but so that the both of us can understand what is taking place. Not every therapist goes into history in the same way, either. The way the therapist practices will often inform the ways in which they collect and look at data.However, above all, my goal, especially in the beginning of therapy, is to work on developing a working rapport with any client. Most research states that the quality of the relationship, rather than modality of therapy, indicates success rates. One of the most essential components of rapport is that someone feels heard, attuned to, and understood."
"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, theyve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy.However, its intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","What you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been triangulated by your wife and mother.This is often seen in families. Its seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.Im not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. Thats what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really dont like each other and cant get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle.Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wifes viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your moms cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours.Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them. They will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further."
"Im planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking but its hard. Sometimes its not a physical need, its mental.I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself. Thats a great first step! Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if youre consciously trying to quit, youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually Ill give in and eat it.Youre going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. Thats normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. Thats what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now., but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.Ive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit your baby!"
"I have secrets in my mind, and I dont know what to do with them. I dont want to tell my wife and mom because I dont want to hurt them. But Im not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself.What should I do? Its becoming annoying and making me anxious. Help me out","It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There are several things to consider before you make a decision. You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them why would it hurt them? Is it necessary for them to know this information? What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? for you and for your wife and mom. Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation? Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you think they would do themselves? If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would you want to know the secrets? How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not."
I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?,"It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. You seem to have some good insight into the situation.The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. I recommend a book titled Boundaries Where you end and I begin by Anne Katherine. Another book that might be helpful is Codependent No More by Melody Beattie.In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship. Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. Needing another person to define you is problematic. Thats too much to expect from any individual.For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. That means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs. It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. There will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs. You have to know how to meet those yourself.When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life. Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you."
"It takes me a long time to fall asleep Id estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?","First of all, exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health. Thats great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For example, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep, especially right before bed time.On the other hand, warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep.Additionally, at bed time its important to keep your room dim, cool and without distractions i.e. TV, IPad, Phone. Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.As far as your nightmares, there could be many causes contributing to them. Certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit. Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender.You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes, depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep, causing nightmares.Finally, Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right away.Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Zs!"
"Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family.However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. Im not sure how to move forward?","First of all, my heart goes out to you. Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome. There are some things that you should consider. First of all, did he seem truly remorseful? If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done, it will give you a piece of mind that it was a mistake.Secondly, was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming, the sting is even more painful. He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.Thirdly, has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this time, he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage, you and the children.Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100 normal.My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist. Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved. I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration, this is not a healthy environment either. If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship, a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needs.Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately, many relationships have endured this very thing. It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles. The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board.Best of luck to you and your family!"
"I have no sex drive due to medical issues. Ive shut down completely and closed everyone out. Ive even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since thats what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned hes seeing someone else.Ive since told him that I wanted to work things out but hes not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back is because Im jealous. How do I show him Im serious?","Im sorry to hear about your current situation. My heart goes out to you during this time.First of all, it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband, you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing. More than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.Secondly, you must be upfront and honest with your husband. Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling. I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him.If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship, he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship.The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof, was not your fault.Best of luck to you and your husband!"
"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together.It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed. Thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So thats what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me.The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasnt an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. Ive treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now Im losing my family and my mind. I dont know what to do.","I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own."
"Ive never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesnt believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either. Im a pansexual, but I cant trust my own parents.Ive fought depression and won however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends dont listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they dont always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","Hi there. Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents werent listening to me. Its even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in.Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we didnt, none of us would be living. Anxiety stress keep us on our toes! Often, I have to remind myself of this as well. However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives.Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety.Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that sounds silly. But, its true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. Imagine being in the Doctors office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards.Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place. Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it!Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students.Lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue.I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best!"
"I have been with my husband for almost 7 years. We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned. I was happy but I couldnt help feeling disappointed too.I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldnt help how I was feeling.We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds. I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted.I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding. What I wanted will never happen.I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset.I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just cant control it. Its ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it. Plus, I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed. Why cant I move on?","Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement. This was something that you and most women think about for years, so its understandable to be disappointed. But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect. You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either.However, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing. How many women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? I assure you that there are plenty.Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. Focus on what you can control NOW. Perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately. But after that, close that chapter and move on. It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change."
Im having issues with my relative. The police never believe the experiences I have been through because I am only a kid.Ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me. Could you please give me advice?,"I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children. Its called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline. The number is 18004ACHILD 18004224453.It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance, confidentiality, and can also help you make a report of you want.The call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.Im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation. You are a very brave and an intelligent child.Please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger."
Ive been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason I keep getting with men that I let emotionally abused me.How can I stop it? I know the mistakes that Ive made in my life. Im having a really hard time getting back on my feet. Can you help me please?,"I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solution.Dont misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed.First, go and buy the book Boundaries Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him I dont need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes. She stuck to that, too. He didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life.These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You cant change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become."
"I have a child with my baby mother. She works I take care of our young son. She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting me down, telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me, but then the next day after our fight she says she does. Im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops. Now me and my family dont talk. Shes always telling me Im annoying and just belittles me. Nothing I do is right.She says I work you watch the baby. On her days off she never cooks or cleans. I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says hes not any thing to her. What do I do? I dont want to leave.","It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child. So if the abuse continues, it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move out.On the other hand, if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state, you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging. It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship. Although your question revealed just a short bit of information, I didnt read about any positives in the relationship.Sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you. However, with time and focus you can do it. Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your child.However, if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship, you have to be upfront with her. You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you. This gives her a chance to render the situation. If after this there is no improvement, I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stay.I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy. Are there any hobbies you enjoy? Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents? Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit.It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family. You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend, especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately.Thank you for reaching out. I wish you the best of luck with your relationship."
"My last relationships have ended horribly. They just up and abandoned me. One of them I have never gotten closure with over it, leaving me emotionally wrecked. I know somethings wrong with me but I dont know how to even start trying to better myself.I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me. I know that I shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy, but I feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me.","Frequently when working with clients, I utilize the ABC model developed by Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an exampleA Action or Event You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B Behavior or Response You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C Consequence You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such asA stays the same.B this is what you change This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C Decreased feelings of depression overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend Feeling better, getting better, staying better by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone."
"Ive been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything.Im always there when he needs my help. He tells me although I help him doesnt mean that I am a good person. He always discredits me as a woman and its hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.","That sounds like a very hurtful situation. Unfortunately, without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop. I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation, and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship. There is help out there and you are not alone. If you need any additional resources in your area, please dont hesitate to contact me."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since.I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that Im falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you."
"About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but Ive tried 3 times. Now can I try but dont stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them.How can I stop thinking about them and dont let it get in my head? My parents said I dont weight that much but, they do think I am fat but, they tell me I am not. I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist, but they think I am fine and I think they dont want to deal with it.","Hey! I am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions, to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself, and to get support! And it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life! Take a walk over to the counseling office at school, the school nurse or consider reaching out to your Pediatricians office. You dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself! And maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health! I am rooting for you! Be Wise!"
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning.Now, though, I cant stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldnt matter. I feel helpless and I dont know what to do.","Hey! It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone! And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings. A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend! Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness. Try this Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself. Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list. Then carry it with you in your wallet and when you need a selfesteem boost, take a look at it! You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities. Reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer. Be Wise!"

"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. Weve had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. Shes on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result.Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm Ive ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.","You are newly married, you Have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. What if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. You know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating. It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay. Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection, I wrote a post about this a while back, you can find it here And have fun with it!"
"Hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks Im obsessed when Im not at all. I give him his space and I make sure hes okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better?I truly want me and him to get better, its kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. Hes a great guy! I just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me. Hes starting to put less effort in talking to me.At this point Ill do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","Im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear, but Id suggest giving him space. Ooph, thats a tough one, right?! I know. But heres the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship. Its the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? Thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now."
I regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me. But it feels like nothing I do seem to work.Ill always love them no matter what and when Im with them nothing else matters. I love them more then anything. I dont want another guy raising my kids.,"How you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far? Repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships. Your love sounds deep, sit with that. Also sit with how shes been hurt. You get to feel your hurt too and your kids. In feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair. If feeling all this is tough to take on, seek out a local therapist to support your process."
We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room. Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop. We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it. His wife my good friend saw us kiss once and told my husband. I told him a couple of things then and we got over it.A year later she told him a couple of other things. Same story. Its been about 3 years since. They are now divorced and my husband and I have been happy. A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did. I decided to just tell my husband everything. We are trying to work things out. But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it. How can I help him believe me?,The issue at hand here is that youre betrayal broke his trust. In order to repair your relationship you will both need toconfront the infidelity. And both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated. It would be really helpful to do this work with a Gottman or Emotionally Focused Couples Therapist. Gottmans The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along.
"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion.Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I cant continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want.We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 45 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","Sounds like your panic is less about loosing the relationship you are in which by the way doesnt sound like its meeting YOUR need for connection and more about being alone. Being with him is serving you, even if the relationship is less than ideal, from being alone. Being alone can be scary. Youd have to face yourself. Youd have to learn to love and care for and cherish yourself. All important skills and tasks in maturing and growing up, but scary none the less. What if...What if you gave yourself permission to be in a relationship with YOU?"
"I have recently separated from my husband whom I have been with for 5 years. Throughout our 5 years together, I have stood by him through 2 affairs, him talking to other women while I was pregnant, his drug abuse and thru verbal and physical abuse.","It usually boils down to a lack of self esteem, self love and self acceptance. If for whatever reason the scripts we have been told about ourselves from others, or what we have witnessed as children has become our beliefs about what to expect from life and others, have been negative, it is hard to imagine a different reality for ourselves.If what we have learned and observed in our close environment has not taught us and inspired a healthy self esteem, then we can not know what it is and how it feels like. It is as if we lack the language, the words to define it and the skills to practice it.Putting up with a loved ones drug addiction, their infidelity, lack of respect and esteem, verbal and physical abuse, tend to show and reflect the degree of our lack of self esteem, lack of sense of self worth, lack of belief that we are worth and deserve more from life.Separating was the first step towards reversing this negative situation. Spending time on your own and distancing yourself from your past experiences with him will give you a better and clearer perspective. The fact that you are asking yourself this question, shows that at some level you are aware that something is not quite right. It is just a matter of finding out exactly what it is, how you got where you are now and how to get where you want to get in your life in the future.Working with a therapistcounselor will help you understand the mechanisms and learn how to build a healthy sense of self esteem. Get a good sense of who you are and what you want. And finally design the right strategy and plan of action to achieve your goal, to move on in a healthy manner.You have made the first step, it is now a matter of being consistent in seeking help and doing the work until you achieve what you want. Become who you want to be and create the life you want for yourself."
"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didnt remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesnt remember that. I do.Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now Im not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.","Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what youve lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation."
"My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back.I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I dont know what to do.","Do you want this therapist to have your credit card information?If not, then cancel the credit cards that you believe may now be accessible to this therapist.Therapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships, such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patient.Therapists are never friends with their patients.Letting you believe that you are the therapists friend, is a violation of professional ethics and almost definitely, a violation of the Consumer Protection laws in your State.Start by dropping this person as your therapist. He has broken too many ethical standards to be worthy of offering therapy.Think over if youd like remaining friends with this person, whom you describe as lacking integrity and stealing from you.If you need help getting back money from him, then contact the police and talk to a detective about what has happened so far. The detective will advise according to the laws in your community and State, whether to file a police report, and what steps are necessary to utilize the Court system to get back your funds.If youd like doing future patients who may be treated to similar ways by this therapist, a favor, go online and file a complaint with the therapists Licensing Board.Good luck!"
"I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house.Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way? This is not a joke. I am trying to understand.","Hi,This sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem good for you for reaching out! My first thought is, these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places. Since they are adults, and you cant force them to seek treatment, you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider. . As far as what to do for yourself set some firm boundaries. Be clear about the expectations of your home. Also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue. I hope this helps you, your family members, and the pets!"
"Tonight, my husband seemed to put our son down through an incorrect approach. His approach was perfectly wrong. I found myself defending my son. I told him that what he did was not the way to encourage our son.Instead of watching my husbands harsh behavior I decided to sit beside my son and, together, we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study. My husband got upset and he was swearing at me. He threatened me. I knew that he was not joking. His words scared me a lot!","I have had these many cases, but in situations like this.... If it does get out of hand, the police do need to be involved. Sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective."
"How do I ever trust another woman? I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet. I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions.Once the relationship was over, she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application.","Im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wife.On the positive side, think of how much you learned by going through this very painful time.Maybe you are naturally very generous and caring, to the point of expecting very little from the other person, for example.Consider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person. Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal, review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behavior.Theres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventures.Theres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again. The first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship. There is no designated time line.

"Im a senior high school student. Im also five months pregnant. I got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years. My parents dont want us to communicate with each other. He cant even come to visit my gynecologist. My mom goes to attend all of my doctors appointments. Shes supportive of me. I wish, though, that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram, at the very least. My family does not understand that he deserves that much. I cry all the time because I feel lost and hopeless.I need guidance and I believe that you can give it to me. Am I wrong for wanting him around? Are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents? I do everything that they ask of me. I just want him to be around. When I ask my parents to let him be here, they call me a selfish person. Please help me.","Youre not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your child.Do your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person? Or, do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life?Ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend. Ask them also to understand your point of view.Now is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is born.Your mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for you.Consider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit. Your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address these.Look online for womens resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this matter.Good luck with the remainder of your pregnancy, labor and delivery!"
"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. Im not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I dont know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?","In a way, yes, you have separation anxiety. Its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection. So, just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it means...that hes forgotten about you or loves you less. It could mean quite the opposite...that hes focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you. He may think hes loving you more, but you feel loved less. You have two jobs to do here. The first is to manage your anxiety by talking back to the thoughts it puts into your head. It sounds like Its normal to be insecure, but I have tons of evidence that he loves me and that I mean the world to him... Find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim. The second part of your job is to let him know what you need. You need more affection and connection during this period when hes away more texts, phone calls, information. Its okay to want that, and I am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when hes away."

"I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my exboyfriend. I am now married, and my husbands exgirlfriend is involved with my exboyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my exboyfriend that I dont want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my exboyfriend started discussing dropoff details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughters pickup details are between my husband and his exgirlfriend. I especially told him I didnt want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him.The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I dont understand where I went wrong besides replying back to his question. I feel like Im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other, and its the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughters birthday, and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her. In my eyes, its the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","Hi. I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your exboyfriendseems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on parental alienation. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have.I will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him?. You cant change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. Youre correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that, but thats okay. Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important. Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement. Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself."
"Every once and a while, I think about my exboyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. Its like I cant get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now weve become friends, but theres this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when were physically in the same place.Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. Im now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know were a really good match. Weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. Hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didnt want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. Im sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. Theyre supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my exboyfriend, and I feel like he does too. I dont know what to do. I need some closure or Im not going to be able to move on from this. I dont know what it is, but its driving me crazy. Im so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. Hes such a good person. I also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I cant get it out of my head. Im trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I cant sleep because my mind is racing. Ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever.I want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend, but I dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I dont want to.Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.","If youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else, its important to pay attention to that. Although you say youre happy, Id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason. Thats a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You cant have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isnt greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future."
"I find myself crying over every little thing, like dropping a glass of water. Today, I got out of the shower and noticed that I had forgotten a shirt. I instantly started to cry. When I made it to my room, I began to shake a little, cry more, and I begged for it to stop.","It is very typical for pregnant moms to feel completely emotionally and extremely teary eyed, so not to worry. Biologically speaking, your body generates an influx of hormones, that affects you neurotransmitters chemical messages to the brain that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, but thats a good thing for the baby. Everyone reponds differently to these changes in mood, ranging from beinganxious to being depressed. However it is mostly heightened in the first and third trimester. There is no guide as to how to handle these emotions, but engaging in various sensory activities like walking, yoga, swimming, listening to music may alleviate your mood. Embrace the emotions that go along with pregnancy and know that it is within the norm."
"Ive worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didnt, and three months later, Im still not over it.Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants. Were no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and hes constantly touching me, so Im still very drawn to him. Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but hes clearly not interested. Hes younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","It sounds like a tricky situation. If you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him, getting over him may not be possible. What makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible. Some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light. If you truly want to force yourself to get over him, cutting contactor setting strict boundaries may be necessary. If you dont see him, over time you can begin to forget about him. If you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches, you will not feel mislead orhave the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested.It would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelingsto change. Thus, being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him. Good luck!"
"I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semirelationship should be joyous, for me, its an emotional nightmare I cant get to the bottom of. Ive had this before and had to leave the semirelationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship?While Im not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I dont take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and Ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","Hi Helena,I felt a bit sad when I read this. This is a new term for me... semirelationship. What does it mean? I know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women Im not sure youre female, but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup. Research tells us that, after a hookup, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then, but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship, and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesnt work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence."
"It has been going on more often lately, but not all the time. It has been starting to affect my driving, among other things.",Its important to make an appointment with a neurologist and ophthalmologist ASAP for evaluation.There are medical conditions that can create this effect.
"My fiance suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she cant breathe or move. Sometimes, she wont even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She wont eat or drink in public. If she isnt having a panic attack or crying, shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I cant even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I cant even get her to drive. She doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive.Some people have recommended medication, but I believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I dont want my fiance pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.","It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, wont be able to resolve her mental health issues. Based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation. Whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. You would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couples therapy, in order to address how you are feeling andbest learn how to support her and your relationship. I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later."
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. Im worried that, at this rate, I wont have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is, whats the rush? Just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that theres something wrong or something to be ashamed of. If anything, I want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it. One of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective. Its important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals. Once you stop comparing your happiness, you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down."
"I have an exboyfriend who just lies about everything. He is super lazy. He lies to everyone that he has a good job, builds trust, and then start borrowing moneyand large amounts too. It has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends. He is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story, borrow money, then disappear. He refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends. I used to think his lying was due to his drug habit, but now Im hearing from other exfriends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life. He would borrow anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 from everyone and it would all disappear. Hes in debt with bills. He doesnt gamble, but he spends his money on random stuff.Although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money, he seems to be a good person. Hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what. My brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother. He takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him. He drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being. Is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there?","It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out. You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him, and this is true of everyone to one degree or another. One question that I would have for you is, are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands? Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you, or would you like them to be different? Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist. Another question I would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior? Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him."
"About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her familys house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didnt understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore. I was crushed!A few days later, she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love, not just sex, but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her childs sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesnt work out for her, we will try again. Im completely in love with her, and Im in extreme pain.","Love doesnt hurt.Your description of the relationship so far, is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain, alongside a deep attraction for this woman.In some relationships, the benefit of what draws us together with someone, is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are, what we value and care about.This sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one. Your descriptions are of the womans life, parenting and relationship dilemmas, not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long term.Try distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday life.Being aware of how much love youd like to give and receive, is valuable selfknowledge.Your ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you, being the result of the womans choices, sounds like the opposite of love.The relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes. It sounds like this is its main value in your life, not that it is sustainable in reality.Good luck!"
"Im an early 20 something yearold virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. Hes cheated on me twice once in the beginning and then four months ago. He wasnt use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasnt sure. We both work at the same job where we met and its with the girl that works with us. Ive been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and selfesteem are low, and sometimes I feel like hell do it again or that hes not ready to be with me. I think about it all over again when I see her. He says hes in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it didnt feel right, and thats when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me. Hes contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because hes in a relationship with me.How do I gain confidence? Should I let him go? If I let him go, I dont want to be sad about it being that we work together. I try to tell myself Im beautiful every day, and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality, but I dont like the fact that she works there.","Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationship.Youre on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend.Since he was the one who broke your trust, he is one in the position of earning back your trust.This is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelity.Understand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationship.If yes, then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationship.For example, some people who are getting over being cheated on, would like knowing details about the affair person, some people want to see the phone of the one who cheated.Recuperating after a cheating incident takes many months.If he tells you hed like earning back your trust, give him some time to see if there is progress in this area.As results unfold, you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally taking.About the girl at work, she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationship.She has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to take.As you go along this road, more than likely, youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you."
"Ive been with my husband for eight years now. We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child.The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away. He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family, she cant help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didnt want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. Hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because Im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.Im of course hurt and in shock. I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart. I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought.","Hi Jayuya, Im struggling in this moment with my own biases. I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect. Your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same. He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours. And now, in an attempt to manipulate and silence you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him? There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you, are there?So, my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that, and I dont think either of those things will help you. Id like to ask you some questions though...Are you happy? Do you know what happy is? Do you know what respect is? Are your children safe? Are your children witnessing violence because if they are, then theyre not safe? Do you have supports? Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life? Have you ever been to a womens shelter? Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly? Thats what I suggest. These are big decisions, you deserve some support. I wish you the best."
"From the moment I wake up, I hear what I think is my voice in my head. Even now, I hear it saying every word Im thinking. When I lay down to sleep, I think of weird and crazy things, and the voice will never stop talking. I dont know if its me thinking. It never stops. Ill lay in my bed for hours just thinking about weird stuff. I should mention that I talk to myself a lot mostly in my head, but out loud as well.","Does the voice in your head sound different or the same as your own voice when you talk to people and go about your usual daily life?There is a great big difference in the type of problem youre having if you feel the voice belongs to someone besides who you are.If you are hearing selftalk of turning over in your mind what goes on in your life, reflecting on alternatives either of what you would like to have done differently in a certain matter, or anticipating what you will do in a future situation, then the problem of the voice in your head may be from a high degree of stress or uncertainty in your life right now.Talking out loud can be a symptom of severe agitation, restlessness, loneliness, and a sense that you are not understood by other people.I would be as concerned about the voice in your head as I would be about the actual content of what the voice is talking about with you."
"Im a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I dont know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldnt like it. My parents are very religioustheyre Christians. We did things every time hed come over to my house. We didnt have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when wed watch movies by ourselves.One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and hes not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. Theyre always yelling at me about how I shouldnt date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now Im kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I dont talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think Im deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if Im still with him, I cant do track and they wont support me. Theyve also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. Im actually very happy with him. They also say Im living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do isif you havent already, have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and lettingthem know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from therelationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not followtheir rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper.Not everyone will always approve of the choiceswe make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you."
Ive been struggling with it for a test and Im starting to believe its something mental. What could it be?,"Hello in Jacksonville,It sounds like you are struggling with motivation to either take or study for a test. There could be several different causes. If you were being seen at my practice, I would ask you to describe your selftalk when engaging in these activities, during the different phases ie. in beginning, after a few days, and after few weeks. Negative selftalk leads to increased disinterest and eventually tasks not being completed. It is great that you recognize that you have the tendency to not complete tasks that you start. Some questions that would be great to explore with a therapist arehow often you start and stop tasks without completing them?how you are feeling when you choose to start stop a projecttask?how many tasks do you complete? Sometimes we need to recognize list our accomplishments so that they do not go unnoticed. Do you ever feel like you are working against yourself?A licensed counselor in Jacksonville will be able to asses you and rule out or diagnose selfsabotaging, depression, anxiety or other possible contributing factors. Remember to continue to provide yourself daily motivation and encouragement towards your goals."
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this. A while back 3 years ago, I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didnt like this. For our New Years resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on boardno more drinking every night.The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing, but I couldnt wait. I asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking. He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. Im not sure if Im overreacting or not. I just feel like Im so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","Hi Los Angeles,So your husband is giving you mixed messages. He says hes willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. It sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partner.Your husbands lying is sending a message. I get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it. Underneath that, maybe its I want to stop but Im ashamed that I cant and I dont want you to see my failures. Ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... How does his drinking affect you? Thats where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out, asking if hes been drinking seems confusing. Youve mentioned snoring, which I guess is a legitimate complaint. If hes passing out, thats a legitimate complaint. When he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or check out of the relationship avoid you? All of these things are legitimate concerns, and Id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. But the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.Theres a conversation that would be helpful here. It sounds like Ive tried to support you in your drinking less, and its not working. What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively? Id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? Can we get the alcohol out of the house? Is he willing to seek treatment?Lay your expectations out really clearly. I wont count your beers, but I cant tolerate lying. You have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? What does he need? Does he let you know what isnt okay with him? He might have trouble saying these things.The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage. A qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart, understanding it, and changing the way you relate to each other."
"I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges.I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was. I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine. I have these urges to hurt someone really bad. I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting. I want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices. What is wrong with me?","What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describe?Maybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions, with how you would wish to feel from relating to others.Since you ask, what is wrong with me?, there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in return.This is true even with imagining doing harm to others.What are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting others?Besides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors, what gain which is not evil, do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being?"
Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year. We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out. But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me.Now he wants me to wait on him to mature. He wants to talk to other people. Then come back in four years. He doesnt want to deal with me while Im pregnant. He doesnt take me to the doctor or anything. I feel alone. How do I handle this situation?,"Well, as far as your boyfriend, sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice. Leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned. However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level. Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up. This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do. Hopefully, someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listen.As for you, how do you handle this situation is your question....you do what you have to do to prepare for your baby, with or without him. A lot can happen in four years and you dont have time, are not required, and cant wait to see what will happen with him. You have a LIFE to prepare for, to feed, to protect, and to love. Can you tell your baby to wait I dont want to deal with you now I need to mature I will be back to see you later Hope you will be fine? Nope!!! As I always say, you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing. Develop healthy friendships...whether with family, friends or new people who may enter your life. Your support system will grow and life will go on...with or with him. Stay focus on you and your baby..."
"I have a relative who is in his twenties. He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again. No one informed family that he was using drugs again. He subsequently overdosed and was found dead.Is their accountability of counselors, therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed? Is there a legal case for failing to report?","Im so sorry to hear of your loss. This sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family. Since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws, I would suggest talking with a local attorney. That being said, I see two competing issues here. On the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owedto your relative. On the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm. Generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapses.A local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation."
"I feel like I was born in the wrong body I feel like I should be a girl not a boyEver since I was young, I have wanted to be a girl. I felt like what I was wasnt me. I want to know what I can do about it. My family is against transgender people and dont want anything to do with them. I want to be me. I feel as if Ill be happy then. I dont look in mirrors, and I dont like my reflection. Recently, I have been taking things to help even though they were not prescribed. I know I should have this handled by a professional.","Hi. Do you have any opportunity to work with a therapist? It sounds like it might be really great to explore these feelings. If you arent able to, there are many awesome gender work books available that you could use to explore your thoughts and feelings. Also google ask a gender therapist so many amazing video blogs to answer many questions! Good luck!"
"Im transgender, I know I am, but Ive only told a few friends. I know I cant tell my family because of previous conversations weve had. They just wouldnt accept it.My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to considersuicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. Its freeat8775658860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a followup question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"
"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I cant be happy without him.How do I get away from this relationship?","Im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly be alone, even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you."
"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite. Since youre giving a lot of empathy, maybe youd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether youve felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly. Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than youd like to handle without anyones kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy youd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of studies and lists and formulas. Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines dont necessarily mean very much. Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent.Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website."
I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.People keep telling me I have anxiety and Im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?,"Anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable. The concern that I can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all and that can become a problem, indeed.As opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you, it could be helpful to start breaking it down. What are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job? Is it being away from your family? If so, why?Once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls, then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue."
I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife. Im not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I dont know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?,"The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you. Im glad you have awareness and Im glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain. Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you. It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong. It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships."
Ive been with my partner for 4 years. Shes given me no reason not to trust her. But lately Ive been overreacting a lot when shes just doing normal things. I think its triggering my bad past relationships.How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?,"Two paths are possible.Youre not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriend.You are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this person.The only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feel.This will allow new light to open an answer as to the truth.Once you know what truly is going on between the two of you, your selftrust naturally will grow stronger.Selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust."
"She refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past. I dont know what to do. My daughter blames me and swears she hates me.My parents say I should just let my daughter live with her dad, but I dont see how I could fix things if I only see her every other weekend. What should I do?","Sorry to hear about your high degree of stress.How old is your daughter?Who abused yours daughter?The answers make a difference to your decision.Obviously if the father was the abuser, then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe, he will not abuse her, your daughter should stay with you.If someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter, then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one another.What does your daughter tell you she wants?Her wishes must be considered too.Relationships can be fixed. Sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other."
My brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. Hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather.I was adopted in by his dad who just passed and his mother will not Get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility. Do I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?,"Thanks for asking this question. I know it can be really difficult to deal with issues like this.To answer your question, you might be able to get you brother some mental health help, even if he doesnt recognize that he needs it. In most states, an individual can request a mental health evaluation of a family member if that family member poses a danger to themselves or someone else, or if they are unable to take care of their own basic needs.You can always call 911 if you are concerned about his immediate safety for example if you find him sleeping outside in below freezing weather. As an alternative to calling 911, you might also be able to request an evaluation from an authorized mental health provider. The deatsils of who you would contact vary from state to state. Heres a link with some additional resources lucky to have a brother who cares for his wellbeing as much as you do."
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but ts so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings Ive never felt before. I feel like I dont want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I cant discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered wrong by a lot of people.How can I get myself to just move on?","Its difficult to move on and let go, especially when youve experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings youve never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation logically. Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that its the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person the RIGHT person. Dont hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. Youre wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you dont want to be without your love for him not you dont want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like its the LOVE that you cant let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Dont try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like its been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I dont know what they are, for thinking this person isnt good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad youve had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons."
"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day not at night. She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat. She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health.I dont know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","1. Shes an adult.2. She lives in your house? She follows your rules.3. What youre describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases theres a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. Im not a doctor this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book Codependent No More which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by helping her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is Boundaries Where you end and I begin. You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult treat her like one. Maybe then shell act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a but... and then explain all the reasons why you cant tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because thats what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents lives are focused around them some more than others and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldnt want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is the right thing but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices."
"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. Ive been really sad lately and for the past few months Ive realized Im just way too dependent on him. It makes me really upset to be so dependent on someone else, but I cant help it. I dont even know who I am without him.How can I be less dependent on my him?","Recognizing that youre too dependent on your boyfriend can be a wakeup call and an excellent opportunity to work on your own personal growth and independence. It sounds like its time to explore and develop your own interests and engage in some activities that excite and challenge you. If you have time, it could be useful to begin a new activity or class, cultivate friendships outside of your relationship with your boyfriend, and begin to reflect and meditate on ways to enhance your own personal fulfillment."
My dad doesnt like the fact that Im a boy. He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me Im extreme and over dramatic.I get so depressed because of my dads yelling. He keeps asking me why I cant just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis. Is this considered emotional abuse?,"Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.Theres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this. Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him."
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?,"Its completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them. When you cross over from friends to a relationship, it does change things. Some people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did Others would be upset. If your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend, then you need to talk about it. Each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect. Then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship. Maybe he wouldnt be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend. Or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him. Most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward. You didnt do anything wrong because it doesnt sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend. But if you really care about your boyfriend, then you probably care about making him upset. Instead of looking at this issue as a problem, try to look at it as an opportunity to connect. If you can both listen to each other and understand each other, your relationship can become even closer."
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone.My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?,"Youre among many millennials who live with their parents due to financial reasons.Does your mother mean rules pertaining to the way your family household organizes its daily or does she mean something else?Every household needs rules as responsibilities to keep the house clean, who does the grocery shopping, the way costs are distributed for this and all the other carrying charges and tasks of maintaining the house in decent order, as well as respecting the privacy and noise level requests of others who live in the home.This set of responsibilities applies whenever more than one person lives with another person.Have you tried simply telling your mom that youre willing to be a responsible household member and that you prefer to keep the details of the way you live the rest of your life, to yourself?This would show respect to your mom and start the discussion as to the areas of your life you feel deserve privacy and how you would like to handle when your right to run your own life overlaps with any household duties."
"Ive been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. I havent been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years.How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help?","Thats a very difficult situation that you are in. But you are not alone. I have several schoolaged clients who find little to no assistance from their teachers at their schools regarding bullying.There are a few options that are available to you to help deal with being bullied at school. One option that I would suggest is for you to talk to your support network. Friends and family can sometimes be good sources of support. Another option would be to speak with us about your counselor, if you have one. And third, there are some excellent online sources of support regarding the bullying at school www.stopbullying.org."
"Im in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks. Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right.Are they right, am I depressed?","Im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your selfesteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have depression.Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future.I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need."
"I am in a high stress position for a tech company. I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing.What can I do to manage my stress?","Hello. Workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive. The interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag, and sorting that out can be difficult. Also, if you are feeling under appreciated and not well paid, this can add bitterness to your lot of emotions. A few questions can be kept in mind as you work through your situation. Do you have the option of talking to your employer about your experiences and feelings with regard to your current work? Do you have local resources that you can use to find different jobs in your field? Do you have connections with employment counselors or agencies that can support you with strategies in dealing with workplace stress? These questions might cause others to bubble up, and could begin a new journey into a new field.While still at your job, what can you do to take care of yourself? Are you taking breaks? Do you eat lunch at the office, or do you go somewhere away from the office to eat? What do you do when you have a few moments to breathe? Understanding that you can indeed find even the smallest strategies useful for selfcare, can help bolster your energy and give you some support as you move through the day. Seeking the support of family and friends can be helpful as well. Knowing your personal limits and when to pull back and take a break will give you a chance to recharge your mental and physical energy, thus helping you face the demands of your job."
"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him. I also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally, physically, and emotionally. Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people.How can I feel more comfortable around other people?","Probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your life.Have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through? It is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questions.Also, understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship. Given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time, the way you socialize will change.Start with one person whom youre pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your life.As a result of how this interaction goes, how you decide to spend your time together, what youll discuss, you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other people.Then, you can consider if youre ready to add others into your world."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I dont want. Things like you arent worth anything. I know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Those critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you, at a very young age.When we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us, feels accurate, we absorb their opinions as our own.Your question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinions.Nothing is wrong with you, everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of view.Start the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel true.Then replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your own.After a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true."
